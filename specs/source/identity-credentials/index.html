An <em>identity</em> is a description of a particular entity 
such as a person, software agent, or organization. A 
<em>credential</em> is a qualification, achievement, quality, or information 
about an identity's background such as a name, government ID, home address, 
or university degree. This specification describes mechanisms for 
reading credentials from and writing credentials to an identity while ensuring 
that the information is only accessible to authorized applications.

      <p>
This is a highly experimental specification that is attempting to unify the
work performed in the the Web Payments Community Group, 
the Linked Data community, the WebID Community Group, 
and the Mozilla Persona team. As such, the specification borrows a number of
concepts from each group and attempts to sythesize these concepts into a
solution that would be easily implemented and deployed by Web developers in
order to provide an elegant readable and writable identity mechanism for the
Web.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
An <tref>identity</tref> is a set of information that can be used to 
identify a particular entity such as a person, software agent, animal, or 
organization. We typically associate 
<tref title="credential">credentials</tref> with identities to access many 
services throughout our lives. For example, we use email addresses to identify 
ourselves to online services, driver's licenses to prove that we are capable 
of operating a motor vehicle, and government issued passports to travel 
between countries. It is the goal of this specification to provide an easy 
way of expressing all of this identity and credential information on the Web.
      </p>
      <p>
There are a number of design principles that have gone into the creation of
this specification. The following is a brief list of these requirements:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
An identity and credentialing solution for the Web should be decentralized.
        </li>
        <li>
It must support discoverability by using a resolvable address, like a URL 
or email address.
        </li>
        <li>
It must support, with authorization, arbitrary machine-readable information 
being attached to the identity by 3rd parties.
        </li>
        <li>
It must be able to provide both public and private data to external sites 
based on who is accessing the resource.
        </li>
        <li>
The credential information must be protected by a secure digital signature 
and encryption mechanism.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
This specification enables secure, decentralized, discoverable, controlled 
access to arbitrary machine-readable information associated with an identity.
Since it's useful to associate varying degrees of sensitive information 
with a particular identity, the specification ensures that a single entity 
can associate themselves with multiple identities. For example, one may want 
to use one identity to access banking services while another identity 
could be used to play online games.
      </p>
      <p>
In order to store the breadth of information that is typically associated with
an identity, a simple but extensible data model is utilized. 
The specification uses a data storage and expression approach called
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ld-glossary/#linked-data">Linked Data</a>. It
is a way of expressing information on the Web that is both simple and
extensible. Specifically, the Linked Data technology used by this specification 
is JSON-LD [[!JSON-LD]].
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt><tdef>identity</tdef></dt>
        <dd>
A set of information that can be used to identify a particular entity such as 
a person, software agent, or organization. An entity may have multiple 
identities associated with it.
        </dd>
        <dt><tdef>identity document</tdef></dt>
        <dd>
A Web-based document that contains statements about a 
particular <tref>identity</tref>. Identity documents MUST be accessible in
JSON-LD [[!JSON-LD]] format and MAY be accessible in other RDF-compatible formats.
        </dd>
        <dt><tdef>identity document URL</tdef></dt>
        <dd>
An identity document URL consists of an HTTP or HTTPS scheme and denotes 
an <tref>identity</tref>. For example: 
<code>https://example.org/identities/manu</code>.
        </dd>
        <dt><tdef>credential</tdef></dt>
        <dd>
A qualification, achievement, personal quality, aspect of an entity's 
background, or verifiable statement by an entity about another entity. 
Credentials may be stored in 
<tref title="identity document">identity documents</tref>.
        </dd>
        <dt><tdef>identity owner</tdef></dt>
        <dd>
An entity that is in control of a particular <tref>identity document</tref>.
        </dd>
        <dt><tdef>identity provider</tdef></dt>
        <dd>
A website providing access to one or more 
<tref title="identity document">identity documents</tref>.
        </dd>
        <dt><tdef>requestor</tdef></dt>
        <dd>
An entity that is requesting to access and/or modify an 
<tref>identity document</tref>.
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Identity</h2>
      <p>
An entity may have one or more identities associated with it. These can be
anonymous identities, pseudo-anonymous identities, protected identities, 
and public identities. The creation of these identities is out of scope
for this document, but typically result in the creation of a long-lived
<tref>identity document URL</tref>. 
For example, <code>https://example.com/identities/john</code> is
an example of a long-lived <tref>identity document URL</tref>.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>A Basic Identity</h2>
        <p>
A basic identity contains at least the type information for the identity.
        <dl>
        <dt><code>@context</code></dt>
        <dd>The value <code>https://w3id.org/identity/v1</code>, or an equivalent
JSON-LD Context [[!JSON-LD]] expressing the terminology necessary for the 
expression of the data.</dd>
        <dt><code>type</code></dt>
        <dd>The value <code>Identity</code>. Note that this field usually 
contains more specific type information in addition to <code>Identity</code>
such as <code>Person</code> or <code>Organization</code>.</dd>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>A Typical Identity</h2>
        <p>
A typical identity will have a mix of public and private data associated with
it. For example:
        </p>
        
<pre class="example" title="A typical identity containing address and citizenship information">{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/identity/v1",
  "id": "https://example.com/identities/bob",
  "type": ["Identity", "Person"],
  "name": "Bob Bobman",
  "governmentId": "123-45-6789",
  "birthdate": "1985-12-14",
  "email": "bbob@example.com",
  "mobileNumber": "12345678910",
  "shippingAddress": {
    "street": "372 Sumter Lane",
    "city": "Blackrock",
    "region": "Nevada",
    "postalCode": "237842"
  },
  "credential": [{
    "id": "http://ssa.us.gov/credentials/3732",
    "type": "PassportCredential",
    "claim": {
      "id": "https://example.com/identities/bob",
      "name": "Bob Bobman",
      "birthdate": "1985-12-14",
      "governmentId": "123-45-6789"
    },
    "expires": "2018-01-01",
    "signature": {
       "type": "GraphSignature2012",
       "creator": "https://ssa.us.gov/keys/27",
       "signature": "3780eyfh3q0fhhfiq3q9f8ahsidfhf29rhaish"
    }
  }, ... ]
}</pre>
       <p>
The example above contains a mix of public and private information. For example,
the <tref>identity owner</tref> may be comfortable with making their 
<code>name</code> publicly readable and would do so using the 
<tref title="identity provider">identity provider's</tref> website interface.
Other information, such as <code>governmentId</code> and <code>email</code>
would be marked as private, and would only be shared after the request for
that particular information has been approved by the 
<tref>identity owner</tref>.
       </p>
       <p>
Information can be asserted, via a <tref>credential</tref>, by a trusted
third party and written to the identity using the mechanism described in
<a href="#writing-data-to-the-identity">Section 4: Writing Data to
the Identity</a>. Not all information needs to be placed into a 
<tref>credential</tref>. For example, 
<code>shippingAddress</code> above is not in a <tref>credential</tref> and is 
thus unverifiable. A <tref>requestor</tref> would have to trust that the 
<code>shippingAddress</code> information provided
by the <tref>identity owner</tref> is trustworthy. Other information, such as
<code>name</code>, <code>birthdate</code>, and <code>governmentId</code> 
have been asserted via a <tref>credential</tref> by a 3rd party. In this 
particular case, the information has been asserted by
the Social Security Administration of the United States government.
       </p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h1>Accessing the Identity</h1>
      <p>
There are two mechanisms that allow a 3rd party to read protected information
from an identity. The first is an
HTTP Signature [[!HTTP-SIGNATURES]] based mechanism that allows any authorized
client to access data that has been pre-approved by the entity that controls
access to the identity information. The second is to use a browser-based 
mechanism that POSTs a request to an identity, allowing the identity owner to 
interactively decide what data access to allow or disallow.
      </p>

      <p>
The table below summarizes the HTTP Signatures-based [[!HTTP-SIGNATURES]] 
mechanism of accessing and modifying an identity:
      </p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th style="white-space: nowrap;">HTTP Method</th>
            <th>Description of Action</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>GET</td>
            <td>
Read all of the information that is available to the <tref>requestor</tref>. 
Note: This may only be a subset of all of the information based on the level 
of access the <tref>requestor</tref> has to certain attributes in the resource.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>POST</td>
            <td>
Used to perform operations on the identity for applications that are not
capable of using HTTP Signatures [[!HTTP-SIGNATURES]] or to perform specific
queries on the identity data.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>PATCH</td>
            <td>
Modify information in the identity using the JSON Patch [[!JSON-PATCH]] 
protocol.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>PUT</td>
            <td>
Replace the entire identity with the provided identity document. This operation 
SHOULD only be accessible to the owner of the identity.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>DELETE</td>
            <td>
Deletes the identity. This operation SHOULD only be accessible to the owner of 
the identity.
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p class="issue">
It's arguable that having a PUT or DELETE mechanism is useful. Both can be
highly destructive and providing a common way to delete identities may be a
bad thing if one experiences a security breach. In many cases, the identity
document wouldn't be deleted, just merely marked as deleted in order to
undelete it in the event of a mistake.
      </p>

      <p>
Not every Web application is capable of pre-arranging access to an identity,
performing HTTP Signatures [[!HTTP-SIGNATURES]], or executing 
HTTP PATCH requests. In these cases, a regular HTTP POST mechanism is provided
for Web applications to read, write, and query information about the identity.
      </p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th style="white-space: nowrap;">POST Parameter</th>
            <th>Description of Action</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>action=query</td>
            <td>
Performs a query on the identity given a JSON-LD Frame in the POST body.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>action=patch</td>
            <td>
Modify information in the identity using the JSON Patch [[!JSON-PATCH]] protocol.
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <section>
        <h2>Reading Identity Information</h2>
        <p>
Reading identity information can be performed in 3 different ways depending on
the sensitivity of the information being accessed. An 
<tref>identity provider</tref> SHOULD
ensure that sensitive information is always transmitted and received over a
secure channel, such as TLS [[!TLS]].
        </p>
        <p>
An identity can be accessed using a regular HTTP GET on the identity URL:
        </p>
        <pre class="example" title="An attempt to read all identity information without authentication">
GET /identities/alice HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Date: Tue, 07 Jun 2013 20:51:35 GMT
        </pre>
        <p>
If the <code>Content-Type</code> HTTP Header is not specified, a response using
the <code>application/ld+json</code> content type must be provided. Other
content types MAY be negotiated for between the client and server. The
<code>application/ld+json</code> content type is the only content type that
MUST be supported for all requests in this specification.
        </p>
        <p>
The result of the GET request SHOULD be information deemed to be public by the
<tref>identity owner</tref>:
        </p>
        <pre class="example" title="An example result when reading identity information without authentication">
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/identity/v1",
  "id": "https://example.org/identities/alice",
  "type": ["Identity", "Person"],
  "name": "Alice Smith"
  "publicKey": [{ "id": "https://example.org/identities/alice/keys/1" }]
}
        </pre>
        <p>
As the response above shows, the only information that the 
<tref>identity owner</tref> has specified as being public is their
<code>name</code> and a reference to their <code>publicKey</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
In order to access identity information that is not public, the request SHOULD
be authenticated and authorized against a known identity. The HTTP Signatures
[[!HTTP-SIGNATURES]] specification is used to digitally sign the request:
        </p>
        <pre class="example" title="An attempt to read all identity information with HTTP Signature-based authentication">
GET /identities/alice HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Date: Tue, 07 Jun 2013 20:52:12 GMT
Content-Type: application/ld+json
Authorization: Signature 
  keyId="http://example.org/identities/bob/keys/4",
  algorithm="rsa-sha256",
  headers="(request-line) host date content-type",
  signature="Gm7W/r+e90REDpWyt.../VebAsNUtvQMe6cTjnDY="
        </pre>
<p>
The result of the GET request will now include information that the
<tref>requestor</tref> has been pre-authorized to read by the
<tref>identity owner</tref>:
        </p>
        <pre class="example" title="An example result when reading identity information with authentication">
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/identity/v1",
  "id": "https://example.org/identities/alice",
  "type": ["Identity", "Person"],
  "name": "Alice Smith",
  "email": "asmith@example.com",
  "mobileNumber": "4424672637162",
  "publicKey": [{ "id": "https://example.org/identities/alice/keys/1" }]
}
        </pre>
        <p>
As the response above shows, in addition to the public information, the
<tref>identity owner</tref> has authorized the <tref>requestor</tref> to
access their <code>email</code> and <code>mobileNumber</code> as well.
        </p>
        <p>
In the event that the <tref>requestor</tref> has not authorized itself prior
to the request, or if it is not capable of performing an HTTP Signature
[[!HTTP-SIGNATURES]], it may utilize a POST-and-callback-based approach. The
following diagram provides an overview of how the POST-and-callback-based 
approach works:

<img id="diagram-reading" 
  style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; 
  max-height:100%; max-width:50%;" src="basicCredentialFlow.svg">
        </p>
        <p>
Once the <tref>requestor</tref> has tried to access a protected resource, 
the website can request a particular set of credentials from the customer:
        </p>
        <pre class="example" title="A request to read citizenship information from an identity">
POST /query?credentials=true&callback=https://flights.example.org/verify?session=7f8nddn HTTP/1.1
Host: login-hub.com
Date: Tue, 07 Jun 2013 20:52:12 GMT
Content-Type: application/ld+json

{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/identity/v1",
  "id": "",
  "name": "",
  "governmentId": "",
  "birthdate": ""
}</pre>
        <p>
The result of the POST request will be a dialog that the 
<tref>identity provider</tref> displays to the <tref>identity owner</tref>
asking them to verify the information that will be transmitted to the
<tref>requestor</tref>. The mechanism used to present this dialog to the
<tref>identity owner</tref> is outside of the scope of this specification.
The result of a successful interaction with the verification dialog will be 
a POST back to the callback URL provided by the <tref>requestor</tref>:
        </p>
        <pre class="example" title="A successful response to an interactive request for citizenship information from an identity">

As the response above shows, the <tref>identity owner</tref> accepted the
request for information and the <tref>identity provider</tref> has performed
a POST to the callback URL provided by the <tref>requestor</tref> via the
<tref>identity owner</tref>'s web browser. Since the request included the
<code>credentials=true</code> flag, the credentials for the information 
requested have been included so that the <tref>requestor</tref> may 
validate the information against the 3rd party credentials.

        <h2>Credentials and Claims</h2>
        <p>
It is possible for a 3rd party to provide digitally signed credentials to be
stored with an identity. For example, if an individual would like to store
digitally signed credentials verifiying their citizenship information, they
would go through the following process:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Go to a government website and start the verification process.</li>
          <li>Provide their identity URL to the government website.</li>
          <li>The government website would digitally sign a credential and attempt to write it to the provided identity.</li>
          <li>The individual would be provided with a dialog to authorize the write of the credential to their identity.</li>
          <li>If the authorization is successful, the digitally signed credential is written to the identity and will be returned in future queries for such a credential.</li>
        <ol>
      </section>

      <section>      
       <h2>Writing Data to the Identity</h2>
       <p>
There are two mechanisms that allow a 3rd party to write information
to an <tref>identity document</tref>. The first is an HTTP Signature 
[[!HTTP-SIGNATURES]] based mechanism that allows any authorized
client to write data that has been pre-approved by the entity that controls
access to the identity information. The second is to use a browser-based 
mechanism that POSTs a patch request to an <tref>identity document</tref>, 
allowing the <tref>identity owner</tref> to interactively decide what data 
to write to the <tref>identity document</tref>.
        </p>

        <p>
The example below demonstrates a digitally signed request to write information
to a specific <tref>identity document</tref> using an HTTP Signature:
        </p>

The example below demonstrates an unsigned request to write information
to a specific <tref>identity document</tref>. Since the request is unsigned,
the <tref>identity provider</tref> would initiate an interactive authorization
where the <tref>identity owner</tref> would verify that the information to
be written is acceptable. The specifics of the interactive authorization flow 
are outside the scope of this document, but are roughly outlined in the diagram
below:

      <h1>Web Credential-based Login</h1>
      <p>
It is possible to use the mechanism described in this specification to login to
a website in much the same way that Persona enables a verified email login. The
process is described below:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
Go to a website that requires a valid email address for login.
        </li>
        <li>
The website requests the email address for login.
        </li>
        <li>
A document is fetched from the domain of the email address checking for a 
Web Identity endpoint and identity service URL.
        </li>
        <li>
The user agent is instructed to retrieve the credential information from the
Web Identity endpoint and send it to the website requiring login.
        </li>
        <li>
The website that requires the valid email address for login checks the
credentials posted by the user agent, verifies the signatures, and creates a
session for the user.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
The diagram below outlines the basic login flow described above.

        <h2>Detailed Flow for Credential-based Login</h1>
        <p class="issue">
While the credential-based login mechanism below relies on an email provider
to be the identity provider, a distributed identity mechanism using Telehash
or some other Kademlia-based Distributed Hash Table algorithm could be
utilized to allow any identity provider to vouch for any email address. This
would result in two advantages over Persona. The first is that a centralized
infrastructure for email address to identity provider mapping wouldn't be
necessary. The second is that any identity provider could vouch for any
email address. The details of this proposal can be found here:
<a href="http://manu.sporny.org/2014/credential-based-login/">A Proposal
for Credential-based Login</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
In the following example, a login prompt is provided on
<code>store.example.org</code> where the person that is logging in provides 
the <code>asmith@example.com</code> email address. The first step constitutes
<code>store.example.org</code> fetching the identity endpoint information 
from <code>example.com</code>:
        </p>
        <pre class="example" title="Step 1a: Web Identity endpoint requested">
GET /.well-known/identity HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Date: Wed, 08 Jun 2013 22:54:42 GMT
Content-Type: application/ld+json
        </pre>
        <p>
A successful retrieval of the identity service endpoint will result in the
following document:
        </p>
        <pre class="example" title="Step 1b: Web Identity endpoint document retrieved">
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/ld+json

{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/identity/v1",
  "identityService": "https://example.com/identities"
}
        </pre>
        <p>
The <code>store.example.org</code> software may then construct the proper query 
to the identity service:
        </p>        
        <pre class="example" title="Step 2a: Request verified e-mail information">
POST /identities?action=query&credentials=true&callback=https://store.example.org/verify?session=8d73j320s HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

Content-Type: application/ld+json

{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/identity/v1",
  "email": "asmith@example.com"
}
        </pre>
        <p>
After a UI interaction with Alice on <code>example.com</code> verifies that 
the email information should be sent to <code>store.example.org</code>, 
the following message is transmitted from Alice's user agent to
<code>store.example.org</code>:
        </p>
        <pre class="example" title="Step 2b: Request for e-mail information is fulfilled">
POST https://store.example.org/verify?session=8d73j320s HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Date: Wed, 08 Jun 2013 22:55:15 GMT
Content-Type: application/ld+json

{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/identity/v1",
  "id": "https://example.com/identities/asmith",
  "type": "Identity",
  "email": "asmith@example.com",
  "credential": [{
    "id": "http://example.com/credentials/23894",
    "type": "EmailCredential",
    "claim": {
      "id": "https://example.com/identities/asmith",

    },

       "signature": "jf48901fu41...23908aszfhdk23h9f"
    }
  }]
}
        </pre>
        <p class="issue">
Note that for the purposes of simplicity in the example above, there is 
no tracking protection to prevent <code>example.com</code> from knowing which 
website Alice is logging in to. Tracking protection is easily implemented by
adding a trusted 3rd party, such as the browser UI or a 3rd party mixer service,
that decouples the identity provider from the relying party.

      <h1>Compatibility with other Login Mechanisms</h1>
      <p>
This identity mechanism is designed to be compatible with other identity
mechanisms in use today such as OpenID, Facebook Connect, and Firefox ID.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>Integration with Mozilla Persona / Firefox ID</h2>
        <p>
The identity mechanism is such that it can be returned in a 
Mozilla Persona or FxID-based login. The assertion returned to the FxID-enabled
website would contain an identity URL which would be compatible with this
specification. This allows both the basic email address to the validated, and
extension information (such as citizenship information, age assertions) to be
discoverable after the login.
        </p>

The mechanism should be able to be used via OpenID, OpenID Connect, and possibly
both versions of OAuth. This section should elaborate how one can provide
pointers to the identity assertion URL using those methods.
