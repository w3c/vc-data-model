        <h1>How to Submit an Erratum?</h1>
        <p>Errata are introduced and stored in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/vc-data-model/issues/">issue list of the group‘s GitHub repository</a>. The workflow to add a new erratum is as follows:</p>
        <ul>
           <li>An issue is raised for a possible erratum. The label of the issue SHOULD be set to “<code>ErratumRaised</code>”.
 It is o.k. for an erratum to have several labels. In some, exceptional,
 cases, i.e., when the erratum is very general, it is also acceptable 
not to have a reference to a document.</li>
           <li>Issues labeled as “<code>Editorial</code>” are displayed separately, to make it easier to differentiate editorial errata from substantive ones.</li>
          <li>The community discusses the issue. If it is accepted as a genuine erratum, the label “<code>Errata</code>” is added to the entry and the “<code>ErratumRaised</code>”
 label should be removed. Additionally, a new comment on the issue MAY 
be added, beginning with the word "Summary:" (if such a summary is 
useful based on the discussion).</li>
          <li>If the community rejects the issue as an erratum, the issue should be closed.</li>
          <li>Each errata may be labelled as “<code>Editorial</code>”; editorial errata are listed separately from the substantive ones.</li>
          <li>ALL substantive errata are generally expected to have corresponding test(s) (such as a pull request in <a href="https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt">web-platform-tests</a>),
 either in the form of new tests or modifications to existing tests, or 
must include the rationale for why test updates are not required for the
 erratum.</li>
      </ul>

        <p>This report contains a reference to all open issues with the label <code>Errata</code>,
 displayed in the sections below. Each section collects the issues for a
 specific document, with a separate section for the issues not assigned 
to any.</p>

        <p>If you have problems following this process, but you want 
nevertheless to report an error, you can also contact the staff contact 
of the Working Group, <a href="mailto:ivan@w3.org">ivan</a>.</p>

 Fix #748. This changes the *MUST* requirement for 
[credentialStatus](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#status) id and
[refreshService](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#refreshing) id to 
be URI instead of URL. The purpose of this change is to
improve consistency with the rest of the data model, where `id`s are 
expected
to be URIs (but not necessarily URLs). This should help implementers who
 want to ensure conformance with the VC Data Model without feeling 
compelled to check whether or not certain values are URLs, which may be a
 difficult determination to make without further specification by 
extensions. For example, there the VC Test Suite doesn't check URL-ness 
of refresh service ids: 
https://github.com/w3c/vc-test-suite/blob/593d5a5fb83f89ba60f32c0443d01fced5b4a3db/test/vc-data-model-1.0/21-refresh.js#L59
 . Also, this specification doesn't seem to define URL or directly 
reference [RFC 1738 - Uniform Resource Locators 
(URL)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1738), although it does 
have a definition for URI and identifier, and cites [RFC 3986 - Uniform 
Resource Identifier (URI): Generic 
Syntax](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986).

The other use of URL, in 
[evidence](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#evidence) `ids`, I have 
not changed in this PR, as that is a *SHOULD*, so I understand it would 
not be necessary to check for strict conformance. Maybe it is more 
useful to leave that part in to indicate the intended use of it?

As discussed on the [2021-09-08 VCWG 
call](https://github.com/w3c/vc-data-model/issues/748#issuecomment-915839459),
 these changes may be substantive, since it changes *MUST*s, but also 
might not be, if it is considered that checking whether it is a URL 
might not by programatically possible as currently specified.

 This PR is intended to be a first cut attempt to address the concerns 
raised in #726 in a way that generalizes the normative language in the 
ZKP section of the spec. I've attempted to keep all aspects of 
CL-Signatures system within the scope so that it's not going to exclude 
the usage of that system, while also trying to call out the more generic
 patterns of ZKP systems that are shared by BBS+-Sigs and CL-Sigs. 

@brentzundel definitely looking to get your eyes across this soon so 
that we can hopefully get this in within the allotted time of the 
charter.

Also worth calling out that because I referenced the LDP-REGISTRY here 
this PR won't reference the Biblio section properly until #801 is merged
 onto V1.1 and I can rebase those changes in here. I intentionally left 
the Biblio portion out and didn't build on #801 in order to keep this PR
 focused on the content for now. Once we get that other PR through the 
link should work properly.

 This partially addresses #733 by updating the text to use floating 
dates. The SVG (claim-example-2.svg) also needs to be updated to further
 exemplify this. I want to do this as a part of the larger work around 
SVGs, so updating this only for now.

 closes #729

Originally it was pointed out that only the `issuer` should be added to 
this example. However, in order to remain consistent with all examples 
including all the require properties I added `issuanceDate` as well 
since it's also a required property.

This updates the text in [section 
4.9](https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/#status) where 
`credentialStatus` is defined to align with [section 
4.8](https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/#expiration) to make it more 
clear that the `credentialStatus` property is optional without making 
any normative statement changes. If we want to update this to explicitly
 say it MAY be used then it would fall under a V1.2 change (which I'll 
be getting to here soon).

 I reviewed issue #405 and PR #418 to get a better understanding of what
 was trying to be conveyed in this example. This is an attempt to update
 the example to close #754 and provide a bit of additional details about
 what's being conveyed with the evidence property in a note. It would be
 good to show this with a LoA type use case like was originally 
considered in #405 but couldn't think of any clear examples where LoA 
would be used with the example University Credential which is common 
throughout the spec.
