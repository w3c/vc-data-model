# Generate of the diagrams

Some of the diagrams are, originally, in the [draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) format. _Any change on those diagrams must be made by modifying this file._  The corresponding application can be downloaded and used directly, or added to Google Docs. Note that, due to some bug in the software, and to improve the exported SVG file, it must be ran through a [post-processing script](https://github.com/iherman/drawio-svg/), to be downloaded and run separately.
