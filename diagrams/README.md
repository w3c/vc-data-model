# Generation of the diagrams

Some of the diagrams are, originally, in the [draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) format. _Any change on those diagrams must be made by modifying the files in this directory._  The editing application can be downloaded and used directly, or added to Google Docs. Note that, due to some bug(s) in the software, and to improve the exported SVG file, it must be run through a [post-processing script](https://github.com/iherman/drawio-svg/), which must be downloaded and run separately.
