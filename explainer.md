# Verifiable Credentials Data-Model Explainer

***by Tzviya Siegman, Wiley; Manu Sporny, Digital Bazaar; Ken Ebert, Sovrin;
Brent Zundel, Evernym***

***NOTE***: "Verifiable claims" are now known as "verifiable credentials".
The W3C Verifiable Claims Working Group's experience with using the term
"verifiable claims" demonstrated that it led to confusion.
The group has since found consensus in shifting to use the term
"verifiable credentials", which contain "claims".

## Introduction

It is currently difficult to transmit credentials such as driver's licenses,
proofs of age, education qualifications, and healthcare data, on the
Internet in a way that is verifiable yet protects individual privacy.

Starting in 2013, the
[W3C Credentials Community Group](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/) started work in
earnest on solutions in this space followed shortly thereafter by the
[Rebooting Web of Trust Community](http://www.weboftrust.info/) and the
[Verifiable Claims Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/). These groups,
composed of 150+ individuals and organizations, are currently focused on the
creation, storage, transmission, and verification of digital credentials.

## Goals

The mission of the Verifiable Claims Working Group (VCWG) is to make 
expressing, exchanging, and verifying claims easier and more secure. The
data model outlines core concepts, such as claims, credentials, and
presentations, that form the foundation of the Specification.

## Non-goals

The VCWG is not defining protocols or APIs. The model is identifier agnostic.

## Getting Started

The verifiable credentials ecosystem is composed of five primary roles:

* ***issuer*** - A role an entity might perform by creating a verifiable
  credential, associating it with a specific ***subject***, and transmitting
  it to a ***holder***. Example ***issuers*** include corporations, non-profit
  organizations, trade associations, governments, and individuals.

* ***subject*** - A role an entity might perform by having one or more
  verifiable credentials asserted about it. Example ***subjects*** include 
  human beings, animals, and things.
  
* ***holder*** - A role an entity might perform by possessing one or more
  verifiable credentials about a ***subject*** and generating presentations
  from them. Example ***holders*** include students, employees, and customers.
  
* ***verifier*** - A role an entity might perform by requesting and receiving a
  verifiable presentation that proves the ***holder*** possesses the required
  verifiable credentials. Example ***verifiers*** include employers, security
  personnel, and websites.

* ***verifiable data registry*** - A role a system might perform by mediating
  the creation and verification of identifiers, keys, and other
  relevant data, such as verifiable credential schemas and revocation
  registries, which might be required to use verifiable credentials. Some
  configurations might require correlatable identifiers for ***subjects***.
  Example verifiable data registries include trusted databases, decentralized
  databases, government ID databases, and distributed ledgers.

**Note:** In many cases the ***holder*** and ***subject*** of a verifiable
credential will be the same, but this is not always the case. For example,
a parent (the ***holder***) may hold a verifiable credential for a child
(the ***subject***), or a pet lover (the ***holder***) may hold a verifiable
credential for their pet (the ***subject***).

A visual depiction of the verifiable credentials ecosystem is shown below.

### Claims, Credentials, and Presentations

The ecosystem roles exchange data enabling the realization of the use
cases outlined below. The data exchanged differs depending on the roles
participating, but is fundamentally composed of claims, credentials, and
presentations.

A *claim* is a statement about a subject, expressed as a subject-property-value
relationship.

### Proofs

The cryptographic mechanism used to prove that the information in a verifiable
credential or a verifiable presentation was not tampered with is called a
*proof*. There are many types of cryptographic proofs including, but not
limited to, digital signatures, zero-knowledge proofs, proofs of work, and
proofs of stake.

The data model does not detail proof mechanisms.

#### Zero-Knowledge Proofs

The verifiable credentials data model supports the use of zero-knowledge proof
(ZKP) technology. This allows credentials with ZKP-compatible elements to
support presentations that enable:

* Selective disclosure of each credential attribute.
* Predicate proofs of numeric values (for example, integers, dates, and
  enumerations) that are:
  * Greater-than
  * Less-than
  * In a range (for example, 5 < x < 100).
* Set-membership proofs.

## Use Cases

The VCWG has created a [Use Case](https://w3c.github.io/vc-use-cases/)
document, demonstrating complicated scenarios and full encoding.

Some simple use cases include:
* A student presents a government-issued identity to verify who she is when
  presenting herself for a standardized test.
* An airline offers loyal customers upgrades to first-class using digital
  coupons. The coupons are issued as verifiable credentials.
* A Board of Physicians maintains its list of board-certified physicians in
  a credentials repository, enabling the board to assert that a physician is
  certified, or to revoke certification as needed. The information in the 
  repository can be verified as physicians apply for positions, or by patients
  as they seek information about the doctors they are considering. This can be
  done as a zero-knowledge proof of set membership.
* A loan applicant presents proof of sufficient income, derived from a
  credential issued by her employer. This can be done without revealing her
  exact income by using a zero-knowledge predicate proof.

## Code Samples

What does a Verifiable Credential look like?

There are many pieces of information that MAY be included in a verifiable
credential, of which there are numerous examples in the Specification.

The following is an example of the ID property in a credential, using the
Decentralized Identifier (DID) scheme.

## Important Design Choices

This section summarizes a number of design choices that the VCWG spent a
considerable amount of time debating.

### Privacy-Enhancing Architecture Agility

The VCWG spent a considerable amount of time exploring various privacy concerns
including, but not limited to, multiple ZKP systems, selective disclosure
schemes, avoiding cryptographic fingerprinting, and the intersection of tracking
technologies and verifiable credentials. The outcome is a specification that
attempts to strike the right balance between what is currently achievable while
ensuring that future privacy-enhancing systems are able to use the same
architecture to protect individual and organizational privacy.

### Syntax Agility

While the document outlines a data model that is expressible in a number of
different syntaxes, there was considerable thought put into the question of
which representation syntaxes the specification would highlight. JSON-LD, which
is a fully compatible subset of JSON, was suggested as the primary format. There
were concerns that a JSON-LD processor would be required to process verifiable
credentials. After more than a year of technical work and collaboration with
the JSON-LD 1.1 Working Group, the VCWG has demonstrated that a JSON-LD
processor is not necessary to conform to the Specification. The vast majority
of developers will be able to work with a verifiable credential as if it is
just another JSON object.

### Authorization

The VCWG debated the use of verifiable credentials as an authorization
mechanism. The result of this debate was the notion that verifiable credentials
could be used in authorization systems, but did not constitute an authorization
system by themselves, and that great consideration should be put into any
system that uses verifiable credentials in an authorization
framework.

### Terms of Use

There were multiple discussions related to how a verifiable credential
should be used. For example, issuers might want to place restrictions on
how a verifiable credential should be used. Holders might want to also place
restrictions on how a verifier can use their information. While there was
consensus that these restrictions should be able to be expressed in the
data model, there was no consensus on what sorts of restrictions should be
suggested by the Specification. The result is an open mechanism for expressing
the terms of use for verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations.

### Proof Format Agility

Currently there are at least four different proof formats in active 
use by participants in the VCWG, including JSON Web Signatures,
Zero-Knowledge Proofs using CL signatures, Common Binary Object Representation Object Signing and
Encryption, and Linked Data Proofs. It was challenging for the VCWG to select
one format because there are a number of benefits and drawbacks provided by
each approach. In addressing this challenge, the VCWG has ensured that the Verifiable
Credentials Data Model is flexible enough to be compatible with each signature
format with no changes needed to the core data model.

### Support for JWT

JSON Web Token (JWT) is a widely used means of expressing claims between two parties.
Providing a representation of the Verifiable Credentials Data Model for JWT allows
existing systems and libraries to participate in the ecosystem.

The Specification defines the encoding rules of the Verifiable Credential Data
Model onto JWT and JWS. It further defines processing rules on how and when to
make use of specific JWT-registered claim names and specific JWS-registered
header parameter names, allowing systems based on JWT to comply with the
specification while avoiding duplicate representation of specific information
contained in the enclosed JSON or JSON-LD object.

### Selective disclosure
The ability of a holder to selectively disclose the attributes in a credential
is recognized as a valuable property, in harmony with the principles of data
minimization and self-sovereign identity.

It was debated whether this property should be required of all verifiable credential
implementors, but it was determined that requiring such capability might be too onerous.
The data model in its current form supports selective disclosure as a best practice,
but does not require it.

## Features at Risk

We have asked for [preliminary commitments from potential implementers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SzfAUA0J72-1BORHJEmY4cdZrQ6vmKy4oq_24r_NwB4/edit?usp=sharing). We expect all features to have at
least two implementations. With current commitments, some features have exactly two.  
Of course we will continue to recruit for additional implementations.

## Implementations and Reviews

The VCWG has begun the process of horizontal review. Feedback from APA and
PING has been, or is in the process of being, incorporated.

This data model has numerous successful implementations, including governments,
universities, major technology organizations, and not-for-profit organizations.
