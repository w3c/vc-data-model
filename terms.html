  This document attempts to communicate the concepts outlined in the
  Verifiable Credentials space by using specific terms to discuss particular
  concepts. This terminology is included below and linked to throughout the
  document to aid the reader:
</p>

<dl class="termlist">
  <dt><dfn data-lt="claims">claim</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
An assertion made about a <a>subject</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="credential|credentials">credential</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A set of one or more <a>claims</a> made by the issuer.
A <dfn data-lt="verifiable credentials">verifiable credential</dfn>
is a credential that is tamper-resistant and whose authorship can be
cryptographically verified.
  </dd>
  <dd>
Note: The claims in a credential may be about different subjects.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="credential validation">validation</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
The process that demonstrates the information in a <a>credential</a> is
well-formed.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="credential verification">verification</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
The process that cryptographically demonstrates the authenticity of a
<a>credential</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="decentralized identifiers|DID|DIDs">decentralized identifier</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A portable URL-based identifier, also known as a <strong>DID</strong>, that
is associated with an <a>entity</a>. These
identifiers are most often used in a <a>credential</a> and are associated
with <a>holders</a> such that the <a>credential</a> itself can be easily
ported from one <a>repository</a> to another without the need to
reissue the <a>credential</a>. An example of a DID is:
<code>did:example:123456abcdef</code>
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="decentralized identifier documents|DID document|DID documents">decentralized identifier document</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A document that is accessible via an identifier registry and contains information
related to a particular <a>decentralized identifier</a> such as the
associated <a>repository</a> and public key information.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>digital signature</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A mathematical scheme for demonstrating the authenticity of a digital message.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="entities|entity's">entity</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A thing with distinct and independent existence such as a person, organization,
concept, or device. An entity may perform one or more roles in the ecosystem.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="holders|holder's">holder</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> may perform by possessing one or more
<a>verifiable credentials</a>. A holder is usually, but not always,
the <a>subject</a> of the
<a>verifiable credentials</a> that they are holding. Holders store their
<a>credentials</a> in <a>credential repositories</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="identities|identity's">identity</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
The means for keeping track of <a>entities</a> across contexts. Digital
identities enable tracking and customization of entity interactions across
digital contexts, typically using identifiers and attributes. Unintended
distribution or use of identity information can compromise privacy. Collection
and use of such information should follow the principles of minimal disclosure.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="identifier registries">identifier registry</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A role a system may perform by mediating the creation and verification of
<a>subject</a> identifiers. Some registries, such as ones for UUIDs and
public keys, act merely as namespaces for identifiers.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="identity providers|idp">identity provider</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
An identity provider, sometimes abbreviated as <em>IdP</em> is a system
that creates, maintains, and manages identity information for <a>holders</a>
while providing authentication services to <a>relying party</a> applications
within a federation or distributed network. In this case the
<a>holder</a> is always the <a>subject</a>. Even if the credentials are bearer
credentials the assumption is that they will remain with the subject,
and if they are not, then they have been stolen by an attacker. This
specification does not use this term unless comparing or mapping the concepts
in this document to other specifications. This specification decouples the
identity provider concept into two distinct concepts: the <a>issuer</a>,
and the <a>holder</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="issuers|issuer's">issuer</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> may perform by asserting <a>claims</a> about one or more
<a>subjects</a>, creating a <a>verifiable credential</a> from these claims,
and transmitting the verifiable credential to a <a>holder</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="presentations">presentation</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A set of one or more <a>verifiable credentials</a> transmitted by a holder.
A <a>holder</a> may create multiple presentations and each presentation
may contain <a>verifiable credentials</a> issued by multiple <a>issuers</a>. A
<dfn data-lt="verifiable presentations">verifiable presentation</dfn> is
a presentation that is made tamper-resistant by the <a>holder</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="credential repository|credential repositories|repositories">repository</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A program, such as a storage vault or personal
<a>verifiable credential</a> wallet, that stores and protects access to
<a>holder</a> credentials.</dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="subjects|subject's">subject</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
An <a>entity</a> about which <a>claims</a> are made.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>user agent</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A program, such as a browser or other Web client, that mediates the
communication between <a>holders</a>, <a>issuers</a> and
<a>verifiers</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="verifier|verifiers|verifier's|credential verifiers|credential verifier's">verifier</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> may perform by receiving one or more
<a>verifiable presentations</a> for processing. Other specifications may refer
to this concept as a <dfn data-lt="relying parties">relying party</dfn>.
  </dd>
</dl>
