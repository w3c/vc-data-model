<p>
The following terms are used to describe concepts in this specification.
</p>

<dl class="termlist">
  <dt><dfn data-lt="claims">claim</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
An assertion made about a <a>subject</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="credential|credentials">credential</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A set of one or more <a>claims</a> made by an <a>issuer</a>. 
The <a>claims</a> in a credential can be about different <a>subjects</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>data minimization</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
The act of limiting the amount of shared data strictly to the minimum
necessary to successfully accomplish a task or goal.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="decentralized identifiers|DID|DIDs">decentralized identifier</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A portable URL-based identifier, also known as a <strong><em>DID</em></strong>,
associated with an <a>entity</a>. These identifiers are most often used in a
<a>verifiable credential</a> and are associated with <a>subjects</a> such that a
<a>verifiable credential</a> itself can be easily ported from one
<a>repository</a> to another without the need to reissue the <a>credential</a>.
An example of a DID is <code>did:example:123456abcdef</code>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn class="lint-ignore" data-lt="decentralized identifier documents|DID document|DID documents">decentralized identifier document</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
Also referred to as a <strong><em>DID document</em></strong>, this is a document
that is accessible using a <a>verifiable data registry</a> and contains
information related to a specific <a>decentralized identifier</a>, such as the
associated <a>repository</a> and public key information.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="predicates|derived predicates">derived predicate</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A verifiable, boolean assertion about the value of another attribute in a
<a>verifiable credential</a>. These are useful in zero-knowledge-proof-style
<a>verifiable presentations</a> because they can limit information disclosure.
For example, if a <a>verifiable credential</a> contains an attribute
for expressing a specific height in centimeters, a derived predicate
might reference the height attribute in the <a>verifiable credential</a>
demonstrating that the <a>issuer</a> attests to a height value meeting the
minimum height requirement, without actually disclosing the specific height
value. For example, the <a>subject</a> is taller than 150 centimeters.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn class="lint-ignore">digital signature</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A mathematical scheme for demonstrating the authenticity of a digital message.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="entities|entity's">entity</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
Any abstract or concrete noun that can be referenced in statements.
Entities include people, organizations, physical things, documents,
abstract concepts, numbers and strings. An entity may perform roles
in the ecosystem, if it is capable of doing so. Note that some
entities fundamentally cannot take actions, e.g., the string "abc"
cannot issue credentials. </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="graphs">graph</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A network of information composed of <a>subjects</a> and their relationship
to other <a>subjects</a> or data.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="holders|holder's|holders'">holder</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> might perform by possessing one or more
<a>verifiable credentials</a> and generating <a>presentations</a> from 
them.
A holder is usually, but not always, a <a>subject</a> of the <a>verifiable
credentials</a> they are holding. Holders store their <a>credentials</a> in
<a>credential repositories</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn class="lint-ignore"
           data-lt="identities|identity's">identity</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
The means for keeping track of <a>entities</a> across contexts. Digital
identities enable tracking and customization of <a>entity</a> interactions
across digital contexts, typically using identifiers and attributes. Unintended
distribution or use of identity information can compromise privacy. Collection
and use of such information should follow the principle of
<a>data minimization</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="identity providers|idp">identity provider</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
An identity provider, sometimes abbreviated as <em>IdP</em>, is a system
for creating, maintaining, and managing identity information for
<a>holders</a>, while providing authentication services to
<a>relying party</a> applications within a federation or distributed network.
In this case the <a>holder</a> is always the <a>subject</a>. Even if the
<a>verifiable credentials</a> are bearer <a>credentials</a>, it is assumed the
<a>verifiable credentials</a> remain with the <a>subject</a>, and if they are
not, they were stolen by an attacker. This specification does not use this term
unless comparing or mapping the concepts in this document to other
specifications. This specification decouples the <a>identity provider</a>
concept into two distinct concepts: the <a>issuer</a> and the <a>holder</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="issuers|issuer's">issuer</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> can perform by asserting <a>claims</a> about one or
more <a>subjects</a>, creating a <a>verifiable credential</a> from these
<a>claims</a>, and transmitting the <a>verifiable credential</a> to a
<a>holder</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="presentation|presentations">presentation</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
Data derived from one or more <a>verifiable credentials</a>, issued by one or
more <a>issuers</a>, that is shared with a specific <a>verifier</a>.
  </dd>  
  <dt><dfn data-lt="credential repository|credential repositories|repositories">repository</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A program, such as a storage vault or personal <a>verifiable credential</a>
wallet, that stores and protects access to <a>holders'</a>
<a>verifiable credentials</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>selective disclosure</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
The ability of a <a>holder</a> to make fine-grained decisions about what
information to share.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="subjects|subject's">subject</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A thing about which <a>claims</a> are made.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn class="lint-ignore">user agent</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A program, such as a browser or other Web client, that mediates the
communication between <a>holders</a>, <a>issuers</a>, and <a>verifiers</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="credential validation">validation</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
The assurance that a <a>verifiable credential</a> or a
<a>verifiable presentation</a> meets the needs of a <a>verifier</a> and other
dependent stakeholders. This specification is constrained to <a>verifying</a>
<a>verifiable credentials</a> and <a>verifiable presentations</a> regardless of
their usage. Validating <a>verifiable credentials</a> or
<a>verifiable presentations</a> is outside the scope of this specification.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="verifiable credential|verifiable credentials|vc|vcs">verifiable credential</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A verifiable credential is a tamper-evident credential that has authorship that 
can be cryptographically verified. Verifiable credentials can be used to build
<a>verifiable presentations</a>, which can also be cryptographically verified.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="verifiable data registries">verifiable data registry</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A role a system might perform by mediating the creation and <a>verification</a>
of identifiers, keys, and other relevant data, such as
<a>verifiable credential</a> schemas, revocation registries, issuer public keys,
and so on, which might be required to use <a>verifiable credentials</a>. Some
configurations might require correlatable identifiers for <a>subjects</a>. Some
registries, such as ones for UUIDs and public keys, might just act as namespaces
for identifiers.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="verifiable presentation|verifiable presentations|vp|vps">verifiable presentation</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A verifiable presentation is a tamper-evident presentation encoded in such a way 
that authorship of the data can be trusted after a process of cryptographic 
verification. Certain types of verifiable presentations might contain data that 
is synthesized from, but do not contain, the original <a>verifiable credentials</a> 
(for example, zero-knowledge proofs).
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="verify|verified|verifying|verifiable|verifiability">verification</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
The evaluation of whether a <a>verifiable credential</a> or <a>verifiable presentation</a>
is an authentic and timely statement of the issuer or presenter, respectively.
    This includes checking that: the credential (or presentation) conforms to the specification; the proof method is
satisfied; and, if present, the status check succeeds.
Verification of a credential does not imply evaluation of the truth
of <a>claims</a> encoded in the credential.</a>.

  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="verifier|verifiers|verifier's|credential verifiers|credential verifier's">verifier</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> performs by receiving one or more
<a>verifiable credentials</a>, optionally inside a
<a>verifiable presentation</a> for processing. Other specifications might refer
to this concept as a <dfn data-lt="relying parties">relying party</dfn>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="URL|URLs">URL</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A Uniform Resource Locator, as defined by [[URL]]. URLs can be dereferenced such
that they result in a resource, such as a document. The rules for dereferencing,
or fetching, a URL are defined by the URL [=url/scheme=]. This specification
does not use the term URI or IRI because those terms have been deemed to be
confusing to Web developers.
