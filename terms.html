<p>
The following terms are used to describe concepts in this specification.
</p>

<dl class="termlist">
  <dt><dfn data-lt="claims">claim</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
An assertion made about a <a>subject</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="credential|credentials">credential</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A set of one or more <a>claims</a> made by an <a>issuer</a>.
A <dfn data-lt="verifiable credentials">verifiable credential</dfn>
is a tamper-evident credential that has authorship that can be
cryptographically verified. Verifiable credentials can be used to build
<a>verifiable presentations</a>, which can also be cryptographically verified.
The claims in a credential can be about different <a>subjects</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>data minimization</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
The act of limiting the amount of shared data strictly to the minimum
necessary in order to successfully accomplish a task or goal.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="decentralized identifiers|DID|DIDs">decentralized identifier</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A portable URL-based identifier, also known as a <strong>DID</strong>,
associated with an <a>entity</a>. These identifiers are most often used in a
<a>credential</a> and are associated with <a>subjects</a> such that a
<a>credential</a> itself can be easily ported from one <a>repository</a> to
another without the need to reissue the <a>credential</a>. An example of a DID
is <code>did:example:123456abcdef</code>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="decentralized identifier documents|DID document|DID documents">decentralized identifier document</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A document that is accessible using an <a>verifiable data registry</a> and
contains information related to a specific <a>decentralized identifier</a>,
such as the associated <a>repository</a> and public key information.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="predicates|derived predicates">derived predicate</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A verifiable, boolean assertion about the value of another attribute in a
<a>verifiable credential</a>. These are useful in zero-knowledge-proof-style
<a>presentations</a> because they can limit information disclosure. For
example, if a <a>verifiable credential</a> contains an attribute
for expressing a specific height in centimeters, a derived predicate
might reference the height attribute in the <a>credential</a> demonstrating
that <a>issuer</a> attests to a height value meeting the minimum height
requirement, without actually disclosing the specific height value. For example,
the <a>subject</a> is taller than 150 centimeters.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>digital signature</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A mathematical scheme for demonstrating the authenticity of a digital message.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="entities|entity's">entity</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A thing with distinct and independent existence, such as a person,
organization, concept, or device. An entity can perform one or more roles in
the ecosystem.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="graphs">graph</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A network of information composed of <a>subjects</a> and their relationship
to other <a>subjects</a> or data.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="holders|holder's">holder</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> can perform by possessing one or more
<a>verifiable credentials</a>. A holder is usually, but not always,
the <a>subject</a> of the <a>verifiable credentials</a> they are holding.
Holders store their <a>credentials</a> in <a>credential repositories</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="identities|identity's">identity</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
The means for keeping track of <a>entities</a> across contexts. Digital
identities enable tracking and customization of <a>entity</a> interactions
across digital contexts, typically using identifiers and attributes. Unintended
distribution or use of identity information can compromise privacy. Collection
and use of such information should follow the principle of
<a>data minimization</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="identity providers|idp">identity provider</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
An identity provider, sometimes abbreviated as <em>IdP</em>, is a system
for creating, maintaining, and managing identity information for
<a>holders</a>, while providing authentication services to
<a>relying party</a> applications within a federation or distributed network.
In this case the <a>holder</a> is always the <a>subject</a>. Even if the
<a>credentials</a> are bearer <a>credentials</a>, it is assumed they will
remain with the <a>subject</a>, and if they are not, they were stolen by an
attacker. This specification does not use this term unless comparing or mapping
the concepts in this document to other specifications. This specification
decouples the <a>identity provider</a> concept into two distinct concepts: the
<a>issuer</a> and the <a>holder</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="issuers|issuer's">issuer</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> might perform by asserting <a>claims</a> about one or
more <a>subjects</a>, creating a <a>verifiable credential</a> from these
<a>claims</a>, and transmitting the <a>verifiable credential</a> to a
<a>holder</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="presentations">presentation</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
Data derived from one or more <a>credentials</a>, issued by one or more
<a>issuers</a>, that is shared with a specific <a>verifier</a>. A
<dfn data-lt="verifiable presentations">verifiable presentation</dfn>
is a tamper-evident presentation encoded in such a way that authorship of the
data can be trusted after a process of cryptographic verification. Certain
types of verifiable presentations might contain data that is synthesized from,
but do not contain, the original <a>verifiable credentials</a> (for example,
zero-knowledge proofs).
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="credential repository|credential repositories|repositories">repository</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A program, such as a storage vault or personal
<a>verifiable credential</a> wallet, that stores and protects access to
<a>holder</a> <a>credentials</a>.</dd>
  <dt><dfn>selective disclosure</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
The ability that enables an <a>holder</a> to decide what information to share
with fine grained precision.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="subjects|subject's">subject</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
An <a>entity</a> about which <a>claims</a> are made.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>user agent</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A program, such as a browser or other Web client, that mediates the
communication between <a>holders</a>, <a>issuers</a>, and <a>verifiers</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="credential validation">validation</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
The assurance that a <a>verifiable credential</a> or a
<a>verifiable presentation</a> meets the needs of a
<a>verifier</a> and other dependent stakeholders. This specification is
constrained to <a>verifying</a> <a>verifiable credentials</a> and
<a>verifiable presentations</a> regardless of their usage. Validating
<a>verifiable credentials</a> or <a>verifiable presentations</a> is out of
the scope if this specification.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="verifiable data registries">verifiable data registry</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A role a system might perform by mediating the creation and verification of
<a>subject</a> identifiers, <a>verifiable credential</a> schemas, revocation
registries, issuer public keys, and so on. Some registries, such as ones for
UUIDs and public keys, just act as namespaces for identifiers.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="verification|verified|verifying">verification</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
The evaluation of whether or not a <a>verifiable credential</a> or
<a>verifiable presentation</a> complies with this specification.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="verifier|verifiers|verifier's|credential verifiers|credential verifier's">verifier</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> might perform by receiving one or more
<a>verifiable presentations</a> for processing. Other specifications might
refer to this concept as a <dfn data-lt="relying parties">relying party</dfn>.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn data-lt="URI|URIs">URI</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
An identifier as defined by [[RFC3986]].
  </dd>
