class:
  - id: CredentialEvidence
    label: Credential Evidence
    comment: A Credential Evidence provides an evidence scheme that is used by the <a href="#evidence">evidence</a> property. This class serves as a supertype for specific evidence types.

  - id: CredentialSchema
    label: Credential schema
    comment: A Credential Schema provides a verifier with enough information to determine if the provided data conforms to the provided schema. This class serves as a supertype for specific schemas (e.g., <a href="#JsonSchema2023">JsonSchema2023</a>).

  - id: CredentialStatus
    label: Credential status
    comment: A Credential Status provides enough information to determine the current status of the credential (for example, suspended or revoked). This class serves as a supertype for specific status types.

  - id: RefreshService
    label: Refresh service
    comment: A Refresh Service is a mechanism that can be used by a software agent to retrieve an updated copy of a Verifiable Credential. This class serves as a supertype for specific refresh service types.

  - id: TermsOfUse
    label: Terms of use
    comment: Terms of use reflect the policy/ies under which the issuer issued the credential or presentation. This class serves as a supertype for specific types of terms of use.

  - id: StatusList2021Entry

    comment: Instances of this class are <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf12-concepts/#section-rdf-graph">RDF Graphs</a>Â [[RDF12-CONCEPTS]], where each of these graphs must include exactly one <a href="#VerifiableCredential">Verifiable Credential</a>.

  - id: VerifiablePresentation
    defined_by: https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#presentations
    label: Verifiable presentation
    comment: A Presentation is data derived from one or more Credentials, issued by one or more `issuers`, that is shared with a specific `verifier`. A Verifiable Presentation is a tamper-evident Presentation encoded in such a way that authorship of the data can be trusted after a process of cryptographic verification. Certain types of verifiable presentations might contain data that is synthesized from, but do not contain, the original verifiable credentials (for example, zero-knowledge proofs).
