# Generate RDFS vocabulary files

The script in the directory generates RDFS vocabulary files in JSON and Turtle formats, plus a human readable HTML file containing the vocabulary in RDFa, based on a simple vocabulary definition in a YAML file. This is done using the [yml2vocab](https://github.com/w3c/yml2vocab); more details about the script can also be found in the [yml2vocab readme file](https://github.com/w3c/yml2vocab).

The generation of the final files is done via a github action (see `/.github/workflows/generate-vocab-files.yml`).


## Content of the directory

- `Readme.md`: this file.
- `vocabulary.yml`: the core vocabulary specification. _Any change on the vocabulary must be made by modifying this file;_ see the separate [description](https://github.com/w3c/yml2vocab) of the underlying YAML format.
- `vocabulary.drawio`: the vocabulary diagram in the [draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) format. _Any change on the vocabulary diagram must be made by modifying this file._ 
  
    The corresponding application can be downloaded and used directly, or added to Google Docs. Note that, due to some bug in the software the exported SVG file must be ran through a [post-processing script](https://github.com/iherman/drawio-svg/), to be downloaded and run separately.
- `vocabulary.svg`: the SVG file for the vocabulary, generated from `vocabulary.drawio`.
- `template.json`: an HTML template file used by the script; it is the skeleton of the final HTML format based on [ReSpec](https://respec.org/docs/). If the file is modified, care should be taken not to change the core structure and the various, possibly empty, HTML elements with `@id` values. The script fills those elements with content when generating the `vocabulary.html` file (and removes any sections that remain empty after processing).
