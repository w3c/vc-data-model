        <h2>Undefined Terms</h2>
        <p>
The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#base-context">base
context</a> of a Verifiable Credential, as defined in [[[vc-data-model-2.0]]]
[[vc-data-model-2.0]], provides a mapping from the standard terms used in
credentials to the vocabulary items defined by the Verifiable Credentials
Working Group, through different vocabularies such as the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/">Verifiable Credentials
Vocabulary</a>. Applications using additional, application-specific terms
of their own are encouraged to create their own formal vocabularies and
corresponding JSON-LD context definitions, to ensure the interoperability
of the credentials they produce and/or consume.
        </p>

        <p>
There may be cases, however, where the creation of such formal vocabularies and
context definitions is too much of a burden, such as for closed applications,
experiments, or examples. The <a
href="https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/undefined-term/v2">Undefined Terms
context</a> has been constructed in such a way that issuers may use new,
hitherto undefined terms by adding this context to their Verifiable Credentials,
which will cause such terms to be mapped onto URLs of the form
`https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/undefined-term#TERM`. If a conforming
document does not use JSON-LD Contexts that define all terms used, it is
required to include `https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/undefined-terms/v2` as
the last value in the `@context` property.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This document provides a proper landing place for those URLs, without any additional definitions for the terms themselves.
