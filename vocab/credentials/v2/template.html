      <h2>Specification of terms</h2>
      <p>
        In general, the terms &mdash; i.e., the properties and classes &mdash; used in the VCDM are formally specified in Recommendation Track documents published by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc">W3C Verifiable Credentials Working Group</a> or, for some deprecated or reserved terms, in Reports published by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/credentials">W3C Credentials Community Group</a>. In each case of such external definition, the term's description in this document contains a link to the relevant specification. Additionally, the `rdfs:definedBy` property in the RDFS representation(s) refers to the formal specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases, a local explanation is necessary to complement, or to replace, the definition found in an external specification. For instance, this is so when the term is needed to provide a consistent structure to the RDFS vocabulary, such as when the term defines a common supertype for class instances that are used as objects of specific properties, or when <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf12-concepts/#section-rdf-graph">RDF Graphs</a> are involved. For such cases, the extra definition is included in the current document (and the `rdfs:comment` property is used to include them in the RDFS representations).
      </p>

          Original diagram is in https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-kg7AzhahSzIwiIHeh5ANGJB_JK-kugs/view?usp=drive_link
          using the draw.io (diagrams.net plugin for google).
          The diagram is exported into SVG, and then the following editorial changes should be done (using any text editor):
          - The "width" and "height" attributes in the top level <svg> element must be removed (to make the diagram rescale if 
            viewed directly)
          - add the aria-details="#vocabulary-diagram-alt" attribute to the top level svg element

          The exported SVG can also be viewed and edited inkscape. (The reason draw.io is used, instead of using
          exclusively inkscape, is because the connecting line feature of inkscape is buggy.)

      <h2>Diagram description</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>Overview diagram of the vocabulary (without the deprecated items).</summary>
        <p>
          The diagram uses boxes, ellipses, and connecting lines with different "styles" (color, end
          marker, line type) to differentiate their semantic meaning; these styles identify Property, Class, Subclass, Domain,
          and Range. 
          These style names are used in the explanation text in what follows. 
        </p>
        <p>  
          In the middle of the diagram there is a column of labeled boxes, all styled as Property. 
          The labels, from top to bottom, are: "credentialSchema",
          "credentialStatus", "credentialSubject", "issuer", "evidence",
          "refreshService", "renderMethod", "confidenceMethod", "termsOfUse", "validFrom",
          "validUntil", and "holder". 
          On the left side of this column, there are four labeled ellipses, styled as Class. 
          These are, from top to bottom, "VerifiableCredential", "JsonSchemaCredential",
          "VerifiableCredentialGraph", and "VerifiablePresentation". 
          There is also a single circle, not styled as property, labeled as "OR", and another box 
          styled as a Property labeled as "verifiableCredential". 
        </p>
        <p>
          The "VerifiableCredential" ellipse is connected through a connecting line
          styled as Domain to the "credentialSchema", "credentialStatus", "credentialSubject",
          "issuer", "evidence", "refreshService", "renderMethod", and "confidenceMethod" boxes. 
          It is also related to the separate "OR" circle with a similar connecting line. 
          The "VerifiablePresentation" ellipse is connected to the "OR" box, as well as the "holder" 
          and "verifiableCredential" boxes with a similar connecting line styled as Domain. 
          The OR box is connected to the "termsOfUse", "validFrom", and "validUntil" boxes with a connecting line styled as Domain. 
          The "verifiableCredential" box is connected to the "VerifiableCredentialGraph" ellipse with a connecting
          line styled as Range. 
          Finally, the ellipse "JsonSchemaCredential" is connected to the one labelled "VerifiableCredential" with a 
          connecting line styled as Subclass. 
        </p>
        <p>
          On the right hand side of the column there is an extra column of ellipses styled as "Class", and labeled as "CredentialSchema",
          "CredentialStatus", "CredentialEvidence", "RefreshService", "ConfidenceMethos", and "TermsOfUse".
          The Property boxes labeled as "credentialSchema", "credentialStatus", "credentialEvidence,
          "refreshService", "confidenceMethod", and "termsOfUse" are all connected by connecting lines styled as Range to these
          ellipses, respectively. 
          On the right hand side of the diagram there is one more ellipse styled as Class and labeled as
          "JsonSchema", connected to the the ellipse labeled as "CredentialSchema" via a connecting line
          styled as Subclass.
