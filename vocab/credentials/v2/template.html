      <h2>Specification of terms</h2>
      <p>
        In general, the terms &mdash; i.e., the properties and classes &mdash; used in the VCDM are formally specified in Recommendation Track documents published by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc">W3C Verifiable Credentials Working Group</a> or, for some deprecated or reserved terms, in Reports published by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/credentials">W3C Credentials Community Group</a>. In each case of such external definition, the term's description in this document contains a link to the relevant specification. Additionally, the `rdfs:definedBy` property in the RDFS representation(s) refers to the formal specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases, a local explanation is necessary to complement, or to replace, the definition found in an external specification. For instance, this is so when the term is needed to provide a consistent structure to the RDFS vocabulary, such as when the term defines a common supertype for class instances that are used as objects of specific properties, or when <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf12-concepts/#section-rdf-graph">RDF Graphs</a> are involved. For such cases, the extra definition is included in the current document (and the `rdfs:comment` property is used to include them in the RDFS representations).
      </p>

          Original diagram is in https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-kg7AzhahSzIwiIHeh5ANGJB_JK-kugs/view?usp=drive_link
          using the draw.io (diagrams.net plugin for google).
          The diagram is exported into SVG, and then the following editorial changes should be done (using any text editor):
          - The "width" and "height" attributes in the top level <svg> element must be removed (to make the diagram rescale if 
            viewed directly)
          - add the aria-details="#vocabulary-diagram-alt" attribute to the top level svg element

          The exported SVG can also be viewed and edited inkscape. (The reason draw.io is used, instead of using
          exclusively inkscape, is because the connecting line feature of inkscape is buggy.)

      <h2>Diagram description</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>Overview diagram of the vocabulary (without the deprecated items).</summary>
        <p>
          The diagram uses boxes, ellipses, and connecting lines with different "styles" (border color, end
          marker, line type) to differentiate their semantic meaning; these styles identify 
          Property, Class, or Datatype, via the shapes used for the graph nodes, and Superclass, Domain Of,
          Range, or Contains, via the styles of the connecting lines. 
          These style names are used in the explanation text in what follows. 
        </p>
        <p>  
          In the middle of the diagram there is a column of labeled boxes, all styled as Property. 
          The labels, from top to bottom, are: "credentialSchema",
          "credentialStatus", "credentialSubject", "issuer", "evidence",
          "refreshService", "renderMethod", "confidenceMethod", "termsOfUse", "validFrom",
          "validUntil", and "holder". 
          On the left side of this column, there are four labeled ellipses, styled as Class. 
          These are, from top to bottom, "VerifiableCredential", "JsonSchemaCredential",
          "VerifiableCredentialGraph", and "VerifiablePresentation". 
          There is also a small, unlabeled circle, which serves as an intersection point for connector
          lines, with two pointing in, and three pointing out.
        </p>
        <p>
          The "VerifiableCredential" ellipse is connected to the "credentialSchema", "credentialStatus",
          "credentialSubject", "issuer", "relatedResource", "evidence", "refreshService", "renderMethod", 
          and "confidenceMethod" boxes, through connecting lines styled as Domain Of. 
          It is also connected to the crossing point circle with a similar connecting line,
          styled as Domain Of.
          The "VerifiablePresentation" ellipse is connected to the crossing point circle, as well as the "holder" 
          and "verifiableCredential" boxes, with a similar connecting line, styled as Domain Of. 
          The crossing point circle is connected to the "termsOfUse", "validFrom", and "validUntil" boxes with a 
          connecting line styled as Domain Of.
          The "verifiableCredential" box is connected to the "VerifiableCredentialGraph" ellipse with a connecting
          line styled as Range. 
          The "JsonSchemaCredential" ellipse is connected to the "VerifiableCredential" ellipse with a 
          connecting line styled as Superclass. 
          Finally, the "VerifiableCredentialGraph" ellipse is connected to the "VerifiableCredential"
          ellipse with a connector line styled as Contains.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the right side of the column, there is another column of ellipses, styled as "Class", and labeled as "CredentialSchema",
          "CredentialStatus", "CredentialEvidence", "RefreshService", "RenderMethod", "ConfidenceMethod", and "TermsOfUse".
          The Property boxes labeled as "credentialSchema", "credentialStatus", "credentialEvidence,
          "refreshService", "renderMethod", "confidenceMethod", and "termsOfUse" are respectively
          connected to those Class ellipses, with connecting lines styled as Range. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The "CredentialSchema" ellipse is connected to one more ellipse, on the far right
          side of the diagram, styled as Class and labeled as "JsonSchema", with a connecting line
          styled as Superclass. This "JsonSchema" ellipse is also connected to a Property box
          labeled as "jsonSchema", through a connector line styled as Domain Of. This "jsonSchema"
          box is connected to a Datatype shape labeled as "rdf:JSON", with a connecting line
          styled as Range. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, on the lower far right side of the diagram, there is a separate Property box labeled as 
          "digestSRI", connected to a Datatype shape labeled as "sristring", with a connecting line 
          styled as Range.
