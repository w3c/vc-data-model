The Working Group seeks implementation feedback, having set the
requirement of at least two implementations of each feature as the
exit criteria for the Candidate Recommendation phase.  The group aims
to obtain reports from two producers and two consumers for each
feature if possible.  For details, see
the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/vc-test-suite/">test suite</a> and
sample <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-test-suite/implementations/">implementation
report</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
The following features are considered at risk of removal due to
potentially insufficient implementation experience (reports):
<code>credentialSchema</code> property, <code>refreshService</code>
property, <code>evidence</code> property, zero-knowledge proof
support, <code>disputedClaim</code> property, JWT support,
<code>nonTransferable</code> property.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
<a>Credentials</a> are a part of our daily lives; driver's licenses are used to
assert that we are capable of operating a motor vehicle, university degrees
can be used to assert our level of education, and government-issued passports
enable us to travel between countries. These <a>credentials</a> provide
benefits to us when used in the physical world, but their use on the Web
continues to be elusive.
      </p>

      <p>
Currently it is difficult to express education qualifications, healthcare
data, financial account details, and other sorts of third-party <a>verified</a>
machine-readable personal information on the Web. The difficulty of expressing
digital <a>credentials</a> on the Web makes it challenging to receive the same
benefits through the Web that physical <a>credentials</a> provide us in the
physical world.
      </p>

      <p>
This specification provides a standard way to express <a>credentials</a> on the
Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and
machine-verifiable.
      </p>

      <p>
For those unfamiliar with the concepts related to
<a>verifiable credentials</a>, the following sections provide an overview of:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
The components that constitute a <a>verifiable credential</a>
        </li>
        <li>
The components that constitute a <a>verifiable presentation</a>
        </li>
        <li>
An ecosystem where <a>verifiable credentials</a> and
<a>verifiable presentations</a> are expected to be useful
        </li>
        <li>
The use cases and requirements that informed this specification.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>What is a Verifiable Credential?</h3>

        <p>
In the physical world, a <a>credential</a> might consist of:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
Information related to identifying the <a>subject</a> of the <a>credential</a>
(for example, a photo, name, or identification number)
          </li>
          <li>
Information related to the issuing authority (for example, a city government,
national agency, or certification body)
          </li>
          <li>
Information related to the type of <a>credential</a> this is (for example, a
Dutch passport, an American driving license, or a health insurance card)
          </li>
          <li>
Information related to specific attributes or properties being asserted by
the issuing authority about the <a>subject</a> (for example, nationality,
the classes of vehicle entitled to drive, or date of birth)
          </li>
          <li>
Evidence related to how the <a>credential</a> was derived
          </li>
          <li>
Information related to constraints on the credential (for example, expiration
date, terms of use).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
A <a>verifiable credential</a> can represent all of the same information that a
physical <a>credential</a> represents. The addition of technologies, such as
digital signatures, makes <a>verifiable credentials</a> more tamper-evident and
more trustworthy than their physical counterparts.
        </p>

        <p>
<a>Holders</a> of <a>verifiable credentials</a> can generate
<a>verifiable presentations</a> and then share these
<a>verifiable presentations</a> with <a>verifiers</a> to prove they possess
<a>verifiable credentials</a> with certain characteristics.
        </p>

        <p>
Both <a>verifiable credentials</a> and <a>verifiable presentations</a> can be
transmitted rapidly, making them more convenient than their physical
counterparts when trying to establish trust at a distance.
        </p>

        <p>
While this specification attempts to improve the ease of expressing digital
<a>credentials</a>, it also attempts to balance this goal with a number of
privacy-preserving goals. The persistence of digital information, and the ease
with which disparate sources of digital data can be collected and correlated,
comprise a privacy concern that the use of <a>verifiable</a> and easily
machine-readable <a>credentials</a> threatens to make worse. This document
outlines and attempts to address a number of these issues in Section
<a href="#privacy-considerations"></a>. Examples of how to use this data model
using privacy-enhancing technologies, such as zero-knowledge proofs, are also
provided throughout this document.

        <h3>Ecosystem Overview</h3>

        <p>
This section describes the roles of the core actors and the relationships
between them in an ecosystem where <a>verifiable credentials</a> are expected
to be useful. A role is an abstraction that might be implemented in many
different ways. The separation of roles suggests likely interfaces and
protocols for standardization. The following roles are introduced in this
specification:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><a>holder</a></dt>
          <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> might perform by possessing one or more
<a>verifiable credentials</a> and generating <a>verifiable presentations</a>
from them. Example holders include students, employees, and customers.
          </dd>
          <dt><a>issuer</a></dt>
          <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> performs by asserting <a>claims</a> about one or
more <a>subjects</a>, creating a <a>verifiable credential</a> from these
<a>claims</a>, and transmitting the <a>verifiable credential</a> to a
<a>holder</a>. Example issuers include corporations, non-profit organizations,
trade associations, governments, and individuals.
          </dd>
          <dt><a>subject</a></dt>
          <dd>
An <a>entity</a> about which <a>claims</a> are made. Example subjects include
human beings, animals, and things. In many cases the <a>holder</a> of a
<a>verifiable credential</a> is the subject, but in certain cases it is not. For
example, a parent (the <a>holder</a>) might hold the
<a>verifiable credentials</a> of a child (the <a>subject</a>), or a pet owner
(the <a>holder</a>) might hold the <a>verifiable credentials</a> of their pet
(the <a>subject</a>). For more information about these special cases, see
Appendix <a href="#subject-holder-relationships"></a>.
          </dd>
          <dt><a>verifier</a></dt>
          <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> performs by receiving one or more
<a>verifiable credentials</a>, optionally inside a
<a>verifiable presentation</a>, for processing. Example verifiers include
employers, security personnel, and websites.
          </dd>
          <dt><a>verifiable data registry</a></dt>
          <dd>
A role a system might perform by mediating the creation and <a>verification</a>
of identifiers, keys, and other relevant data, such as
<a>verifiable credential</a> schemas, revocation registries, issuer public keys,
and so on, which might be required to use <a>verifiable credentials</a>. Some
configurations might require correlatable identifiers for <a>subjects</a>.
Example verifiable data registries include trusted databases, decentralized
databases, government ID databases, and distributed ledgers. Often
there is more than one type of verifiable data registry utilized in an
ecosystem.
          </dd>

rest of the concepts in this specification. Other ecosystems exist, such as
protected environments or proprietary systems, where
<a>verifiable credentials</a> also provide benefit.

        <h3>Use Cases and Requirements</h3>

        <p>
The Verifiable Credentials Use Cases document [[VC-USECASES]] outlines a number
of key topics that readers might find useful, including:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>

          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
As a result of documenting and analyzing the use cases document, the following
desirable ecosystem characteristics were identified for this specification:
        </p>
<!-- requirement list start -->
        <ul>
          <li>
<a>Verifiable credentials</a> represent statements made by an <a>issuer</a> in
a tamper-evident and privacy-respecting manner.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Holders</a> assemble collections of <a>verifiable credentials</a> from
different <a>issuers</a> into a single artifact, a
<a>verifiable presentation</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Issuers</a> can issue <a>verifiable credentials</a> about any <a>subject</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
Acting as <a>issuer</a>, <a>holder</a>, or <a>verifier</a> requires neither
registration nor approval by any authority, as the trust involved is bilateral
between parties.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Verifiable presentations</a> allow any <a>verifier</a> to <a>verify</a> the
authenticity of <a>verifiable credentials</a> from any <a>issuer</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Holders</a> can receive <a>verifiable credentials</a> from anyone.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Holders</a> can interact with any <a>issuer</a> and any <a>verifier</a>
through any user agent.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Holders</a> can share <a>verifiable presentations</a>, which can then be
<a>verified</a> without revealing the identity of the <a>verifier</a> to the
<a>issuer</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Holders</a> can store <a>verifiable credentials</a> in any location, without
affecting their <a>verifiability</a> and without the <a>issuer</a> knowing
anything about where they are stored or when they are accessed.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Holders</a> can present <a>verifiable presentations</a> to any
<a>verifier</a> without affecting authenticity of the claims and without
revealing that action to the <a>issuer</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
A <a>verifier</a> can <a>verify</a> <a>verifiable presentations</a> from any
<a>holder</a>, containing proofs of <a>claims</a> from any <a>issuer</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Verification</a> should not depend on direct interactions between
<a>issuers</a> and <a>verifiers</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Verification</a> should not reveal the identity of the <a>verifier</a> to
any <a>issuer</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
The specification must provide a means for <a>issuers</a> to issue
<a>verifiable credentials</a> that support selective disclosure, without
requiring all conformant software to support that feature.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Issuers</a> can issue <a>verifiable credentials</a> that support
selective disclosure.
          </li>
          <li>
If a single <a>verifiable credential</a> supports selective disclosure, then
<a>holders</a> can present proofs of <a>claims</a> without revealing the entire
<a>verifiable credential</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Verifiable presentations</a> can either disclose the attributes of a
<a>verifiable credential</a>, or satisfy <a>derived predicates</a> requested by
the <a>verifier</a>. <a>Derived predicates</a> are Boolean conditions, such as
greater than, less than, equal to, is in set, and so on.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Issuers</a> can issue revocable <a>verifiable credentials</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Verifiable credentials</a> and <a>verifiable presentations</a> have to be
serializable in one or more machine-readable data formats. The process of serialization
and/or de-serialization has to be deterministic, bi-directional, and lossless.
Any serialization of a <a>verifiable credential</a> or <a>verifiable presentation</a> needs to
be transformable to the generic data model defined in this document in a deterministic
process such that the resulting <a>verifiable credential</a> can be processed
in an interoperable fashion. The serialized form also needs to be able
to be generated from the data model without loss of data or content.
          </li>
          <li>
The data model and serialization must be extendable with minimal coordination.
          </li>
          <li>
Revocation by the <a>issuer</a> should not reveal any identifying information
about the <a>subject</a>, the <a>holder</a>, the specific
<a>verifiable credential</a>, or the <a>verifier</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Issuers</a> can disclose the revocation reason.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Issuers</a> revoking <a>verifiable credentials</a> should distinguish between
revocation for cryptographic integrity (for example, the signing key is
compromised) versus revocation for a status change (for example, the driver’s
license is suspended).
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Issuers</a> can provide a service for refreshing a
<a>verifiable credential</a>.
          </li>

      <section id="conformance" class="normative">
        <p>
A <em>conforming document</em> is any concrete expression of the data model
that complies with the normative statements in this specification.
Specifically, all relevant normative statements in Sections
<a href="#basic-concepts"></a>, <a href="#advanced-concepts"></a>, and
<a href="#syntaxes"></a> of this document MUST be enforced.
        </p>

        <p>
A <em>conforming processor</em> is any algorithm realized as software and/or
hardware that generates or consumes a <em>conforming document</em>. Conforming
processors MUST produce errors when non-conforming documents are consumed.
        </p>

        <p>
This specification makes no normative statements with regard to the
conformance of roles in the ecosystem, such as <a>issuers</a>, <a>holders</a>,
or <a>verifiers</a>, because the conformance of ecosystem roles are highly
application, use case, and market vertical specific.
        </p>

        <p>
Digital proof mechanisms, a subset of which are digital signatures, are required
to ensure the protection of a <a>verifiable credential</a>. Having and
validating proofs, which may be dependent on the syntax of the proof
(for example, using the JWS of a JWT for proofing a key holder), are
an essential part of processing a <a>verifiable credential</a>. At the time
of publication, Working Group members had implemented
<a>verifiable credentials</a> using at least three proof mechanisms:
JSON Web Tokens [[JWT]], Linked Data Signatures [[?LD-SIGNATURES]], and
Camenisch-Lysyanskaya Zero-Knowledge Proofs [[?CL-SIGNATURES]]. The group
expects some of these mechanisms, as well as new ones, to mature independently
and become standardized in time. Given that there are multiple valid
proof mechanisms, this specification does not standardize on any
single digital signature mechanism. One of the goals of this specification is to
provide a data model that can be protected by a variety of current and future
digital proof mechanisms. Conformance to this specification does not
depend on the details of a particular proof mechanism; it requires clearly
identifying the mechanism a <a>verifiable credential</a> uses.

      <h2>Core Data Model</h2>

      <p>
The following sections outline core data model concepts, such as
<a>claims</a>, <a>credentials</a>, and <a>presentations</a>, which form the
foundation of this specification.
      </p>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Claims</h3>

        <p>
A <a>claim</a> is a statement about a <a>subject</a>. A <a>subject</a> is
a thing about which <a>claims</a> can be made. <a>Claims</a> are
expressed using
<strong><em>subject</em></strong>-<dfn data-lt="property|properties">property</dfn>-<dfn>value</dfn>
relationships.
        </p>

        <figure id="basic-structure">
          <img style="margin: auto; display: block; width: 50%;"
            src="diagrams/claim.svg" alt="subject has a property which
            has a value">
          <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
The basic structure of a claim.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
The data model for <a>claims</a>, described in <a href="#basic-structure"></a>
above, is powerful and can be used to express a large variety of statements. For
example, whether someone graduated from a particular university can be expressed
as shown in <a href="#basic-example"></a> below.
        </p>

        <figure id="basic-example">
          <img style="margin: auto; display: block; width: 60%;"
            src="diagrams/claim-example.svg" alt="Pat has an alumniOf
            property whose value is Example University">
          <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
A basic claim expressing that Pat is an alumni of "Example University".
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
Individual <a>claims</a> can be merged together to express a <a>graph</a> of
information about a <a>subject</a>. The example shown in
<a href="#multiple-claims"></a> below extends the previous <a>claim</a> by
adding the <a>claims</a> that Pat knows Sam and that Sam is employed as a
professor.
        </p>

        <figure id="multiple-claims">
          <img style="margin: auto; display: block; width: 75%;"
            src="diagrams/claim-extended.svg" alt="extends previous

Multiple claims can be combined to express a graph of information.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
To this point, the concepts of a <a>claim</a> and a <a>graph</a> of information
are introduced. To be able to trust <a>claims</a>, more information must be
added.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Credentials</h3>

        <p>
A <a>credential</a> is a set of one or more <a>claims</a> made by the same
<a>entity</a>. <a>Credentials</a> might also include an identifier and
metadata to describe properties of the <a>credential</a>, such as the
<a>issuer</a>, the expiry date and time, a representative image, a public key
to use for <a>verification</a> purposes, the revocation mechanism, and so on.
The metadata might be signed by the <a>issuer</a>. A
<a>verifiable credential</a> is a set of tamper-evident <a>claims</a> and
metadata that cryptographically prove who issued it.
        </p>

        <p>
Examples of <a>verifiable credentials</a> include digital employee
identification cards, digital birth certificates, and digital educational
certificates.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
<a>Credential</a> identifiers are often used to identify specific instances
of a <a>credential</a>. These identifiers can also be used for correlation. A
<a>holder</a> wanting to minimize correlation is advised to use a selective
disclosure scheme that does not reveal the <a>credential</a> identifier.
        </p>

        <p>
<a href="#basic-vc"></a> above shows the basic components of a
<a>verifiable credential</a>, but abstracts the details about how <a>claims</a>
are organized into information <a>graphs</a>, which are then organized into
<a>verifiable credentials</a>. <a href="#info-graph-vc"></a> below shows a
more complete depiction of a <a>verifiable credential</a>,
which is normally composed of at least two information <a>graphs</a>. The first
<a>graph</a> expresses the <a>verifiable credential</a> itself, which contains
<span class="color-text" style="color:#d5a6bd;">credential metadata</span> and
<span class="color-text" style="color:#ffe599;">claims</span>. The second
<a>graph</a> expresses the
<span class="color-text" style="color:#b6d7a8;">digital proof</span>, which is
usually a digital signature.

It is possible to have a <a>credential</a>, such as a marriage certificate,

        <p class="note">
It is possible to have a <a>credential</a> that does not contain any claims
about the entity to which the credential was issued. An example is a credential
that only contains claims about a specific dog, but is issued to its owner.

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Presentations</h3>

        <p>
Enhancing privacy is a key design feature of this specification. Therefore, it
is important for <a>entities</a> using this technology to be able to
express only the portions of their persona that are appropriate for a given
situation. The expression of a subset of one's persona is called a
<a>verifiable presentation</a>. Examples of different personas include a
person's professional persona, their online gaming persona, their
family persona, or an incognito persona.
        </p>

        <p>
A <a>verifiable presentation</a> expresses data from one or more
<a>verifiable credentials</a>, and is packaged in such a way that the
authorship of the data is <a>verifiable</a>. If <a>verifiable credentials</a>
are presented directly, they become a <a>verifiable presentation</a>. Data
formats derived from <a>verifiable credentials</a> that are cryptographically
<a>verifiable</a>, but do not of themselves contain
<a>verifiable credentials</a>, might also be <a>verifiable presentations</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
The data in a <a>presentation</a> is often about the same <a>subject</a>, but
was issued by multiple <a>issuers</a>. The aggregation of this information
typically expresses an aspect of a person, organization, or <a>entity</a>.

The <code>verifiablePresentation</code> property in the <a>graph</a> refers to
one or more <a>verifiable credentials</a> (each a self-contained <a>graph</a>),
which in turn contains
<span class="color-text" style="color:#d5a6bd;">credential metadata</span> and
<span class="color-text" style="color:#ffe599;">claims</span>.

        <h3>Concrete Lifecycle Example</h3>

        <p>
The previous sections introduced the concepts of <a>claims</a>,
<a>verifiable credentials</a>, and <a>verifiable presentations</a> using
graphical depictions. This section provides a concrete set of simple but
complete lifecycle examples of the data model expressed in one of the concrete
syntaxes supported by this specification. The lifecycle of <a>credentials</a>
and <a>presentations</a> in the
<a href="#ecosystem-overview">Verifiable Credentials Ecosystem</a> often
take a common path:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
Issuance of one or more <a>verifiable credentials</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
Storage of <a>verifiable credentials</a> in a <a>credential repository</a>
(such as a digital wallet).
          </li>
          <li>
Composition of <a>verifiable credentials</a> into a
<a>verifiable presentation</a> for <a>verifiers</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Verification</a> of the <a>verifiable presentation</a> by the
<a>verifier</a>.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
We will use concrete examples to illustrate the lifecycle above by
demonstrating how to redeem an alumni discount from a university. In the
example below, Pat receives an alumni <a>verifiable credential</a> from a
university that will be stored in Pat's digital wallet.

ticket. A step in the process requests an alumni <a>verifiable credential</a>
and the request is routed to Pat's digital wallet. The digital wallet asks Pat

      <h2>Basic Concepts</h2>

      <p>
This section introduces some basic concepts for the specification, in
preparation for Section <a href="#advanced-concepts"></a> later in the
document.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Contexts</h3>

        <p>
When two software systems need to exchange data, they must use terminology and
a protocol that both systems understand. As an analogy, consider how two
people communicate. Both people must use the same language and the words they
use must mean the same thing to each other. This is often referred to as
"the context in which a conversation happens". This specification defines the
use of the <code>@context</code> <a>property</a> when communicating information
related to specific <a>verifiable credentials</a> or
<a>verifiable presentations</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
<a>Verifiable credentials</a> and <a>verifiable presentations</a> MUST include a
<code>@context</code> <a>property</a>.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>@context</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
The value of the <code>@context</code> <a>property</a> MUST be an ordered set
where the first item is a <a>URI</a> with the value
<code>https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1</code>. Subsequent items in the
array MUST be composed of any combination of <a>URIs</a> or objects that
express context information. It is RECOMMENDED that dereferencing the
<a>URIs</a> results in a document containing machine-readable information about
the context.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p class="note">
Though this specification requires that a <code>@context</code> <a>property</a>
be present, there is no requirement that the value of the <code>@context</code>
property be processed using JSON-LD. This is to support processing using plain
JSON libraries such as those that may be used when the
<a>verifiable credential</a> is encoded as a JWT.
JSON-LD aware processors can process the <code>@context</code> using full
JSON-LD processing as expected. For other processors, the only processing
necessary is to ensure that the order of the values in <code>@context</code>
is what is expected for the particular application, but no JSON-LD processing
of those values is required.
        </p>

        <h3>Identifiers</h3>

        <p>
When expressing statements about a specific thing, such as a person, product,
or organization, it is often useful to use some kind of identifier so that
others can express statements about the same thing. This specification defines
the <code>id</code> <a>property</a> for identifiers. The <code>id</code>
<a>property</a> is intended to unambiguously refer to an object such as a person,
product, or organization. This allows for the expression of statements about
specific things in the verifiable credential. If present, identifiers that
others are expected to use when expressing statements about a specific thing
MUST be expressed using the <code>id</code> <a>property</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
Developers should remember that identifiers might be harmful in scenarios
where pseudonymity is required. Developers are encouraged to read
Section <a href="#privacy-considerations"></a> carefully when considering
such scenarios. Where privacy is a strong consideration, the <code>id</code>
<a>property</a> MAY be omitted.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>id</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
The value of the <code>id</code> <a>property</a> MUST be a single <a>URI</a>.
It is RECOMMENDED that dereferencing the <a>URI</a> results in a document
containing machine-readable information about the identifier.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        </pre>

        <p>
The example above uses two types of identifiers. The first identifier is for
the <a>verifiable credential</a> and uses an HTTP-based URL. The second
identifier is for the <a>subject</a> of the <a>verifiable credential</a> (the
thing the <a>claims</a> are about) and uses a <a>decentralized identifier</a>,
also known as a <a>DID</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
As of this publication, <a>DIDs</a> are a new type of identifier that are not
necessary for <a>verifiable credentials</a> to be useful. Specifically,
<a>verifiable credentials</a> do not depend on <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DIDs</a> do
not depend on <a>verifiable credentials</a>. However, it is expected that many
<a>verifiable credentials</a> will use <a>DIDs</a> and that software libraries
implementing this specification will probably need to resolve <a>DIDs</a>.
<a>DID</a>-based URLs are used for expressing identifiers associated with
<a>subjects</a>, <a>issuers</a>, <a>holders</a>, credential status lists,
cryptographic keys, and other machine-readable information that is associated
with a <a>verifiable credential</a>.

        <h3>Types</h3>

        <p>
Software systems that process the kinds of objects specified in this document
use type information to determine whether or not a provided
<a>verifiable credential</a> or <a>verifiable presentation</a> is appropriate.
This specification defines a <code>type</code> <a>property</a> for the
expression of type information.
        </p>

        <p>
<a>Verifiable credentials</a> and <a>verifiable presentations</a> MUST have a
<code>type</code> <a>property</a>.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn data-lt="type|types">type</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
The value of the <code>type</code> <a>property</a> MUST be, or map to (via
interpretation of the <code>@context</code> property), one or more <a>URIs</a>.
If more than one <a>URI</a> is provided, the <a>URIs</a> MUST be interpreted
as an unordered set. Syntactic conveniences, such as JSON-LD terms, SHOULD
be used to ease developer usage. It is RECOMMENDED that dereferencing the
<a>URIs</a> results in a document containing machine-readable information
about the type.

        <p class="note">
The <a>type</a> system for the Verifiable Credentials Data Model is the same as
for [[JSON-LD]] and is detailed in
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#specifying-the-type">Section 5.4:
Specifying the Type</a> and
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#json-ld-grammar">Section 8: JSON-LD
Grammar</a>. When using a JSON-LD context (see Section
<a href="#extensibility"></a>), this specification aliases the
<code>@type</code> keyword to <code>type</code> to make the JSON-LD documents
more easily understood. While application developers and document authors do
not need to understand the specifics of the JSON-LD type system, implementers
of this specification who want to support interoperable extensibility, do.
        </p>

        <p>
All <a>credentials</a>, <a>presentations</a>, and encapsulated objects MUST
specify, or be associated with, additional more narrow <a>types</a> (like
<code>UniversityDegreeCredential</code>, for example) so software systems can
process this additional information.
        </p>

        <p>
When processing encapsulated objects defined in this specification, (for
example, objects associated with the <code>credentialSubject</code> object or
deeply nested therein), software systems SHOULD use the <a>type</a> information
specified in encapsulating objects higher in the hierarchy. Specifically, an
encapsulating object, such as a <a>credential</a>, SHOULD convey the associated
object <a>types</a> so that <a>verifiers</a> can quickly determine the contents
of an associated object based on the encapsulating object <a>type</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
For example, a <a>credential</a> object with the <code>type</code> of
<code>UniversityDegreeCredential</code>, signals to a <a>verifier</a> that the
object associated with the <code>credentialSubject</code> property contains the
identifier for the:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
<a>Subject</a> in the <code>id</code> property.
          </li>
          <li>
The type of degree in the <code>type</code> property.
          </li>
          <li>
The title of the degree in the <code>name</code> property.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
This enables implementers to rely on values associated with the
<code>type</code> property for <a>verification</a> purposes. The expectation of
<a>types</a> and their associated properties should be documented in at least a
human-readable specification, and preferably, in an additional machine-readable
representation.

        <h3>Credential Subject</h3>

        <p>
A <a>verifiable credential</a> contains <a>claims</a> about one or

<a>claims</a> about one or more <a>subjects</a>.

        <h3>Proofs (Signatures)</h3>

        <p>
For a <a>credential</a> or <a>presentation</a> to be <a>verifiable</a>, at
least one proof mechanism MUST be expressed. This specification identifies
two classes of proof mechanisms: external proofs and embedded proofs. An
<dfn>external proof</dfn> is one that wraps an expression of this data model,
such as a JSON Web Token, which is elaborated upon in Section
<a href="#json-web-token"></a>. An <dfn>embedded proof</dfn> is a mechanism
where the proof is included in the data, such as a Linked Data Signature,
which is elaborated upon in Section <a href="#linked-data-proofs"></a>.
When embedding a proof, the following <a>property</a> MUST be used:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><var>proof</var></dt>
          <dd>
One or more cryptographic proofs that can be used to detect tampering and
verify the authorship of a <a>credential</a> or <a>presentation</a>.
The specific method used for an <a>embedded proof</a> MUST be included using
the <code>type</code> <a>property</a>.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
Because the method used for a mathematical proof varies by representation
language and the technology used, the set of name-value pairs that is expected
as the value of the <code>proof</code> <a>property</a> will vary accordingly.
For example, if digital signatures are used for the proof mechanism, the
<code>proof</code> <a>property</a> is expected to have name-value pairs that
include a signature, a reference to the signing entity, and a representation of
the signing date. The example below uses RSA digital signatures.

whether it is suspended or revoked:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><var>credentialStatus</var></dt>
          <dd>
The value of the <code>credentialStatus</code> <a>property</a> MUST include the:

            <ul>
              <li>
<code>id</code> <a>property</a>, which MUST be a URL.
              </li>
              <li>
<code>type</code> <a>property</a>, which expresses the <a>credential</a> status
type (also referred to as the <a>credential</a> status method). It is expected
that the value will provide enough information to determine the current status
of the <a>credential</a>. For example, the object could contain a link to an

        <p>
The precise contents of the <a>credential</a> status information is determined
by the specific <code>credentialStatus</code> <a>type</a> definition, and varies
depending on factors such as whether it is simple to implement or if it is
privacy-enhancing.

status checking.

        <h3>Presentations</h3>

        <p>
<a>Verifiable presentations</a> MAY be used to combine and present
<a>verifiable credentials</a>. They are packaged in such a way that the
authorship of the data is <a>verifiable</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
If <a>verifiable presentations</a> are used, they MUST be constructed from
<a>verifiable credentials</a> themselves, or of data derived from
<a>verifiable credentials</a> in a cryptographically <a>verifiable</a> format.
The <code>id</code> <a>property</a> is optional and MAY be used to provide a
unique identifier for the presentation. The value associated with the
<code>id</code> property MUST be a <a>URI</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
The data in a <a>presentation</a> is often about the same <a>subject</a>, but
was issued by multiple <a>issuers</a>. The aggregation of information from
multiple <a>verifiable credentials</a> is a typical use of
<a>verifiable presentations</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
The example below shows a <a>verifiable presentation</a> that embeds
<a>verifiable credentials</a>.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Basic structure of a presentation">
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1"
  ],

  "type": ["VerifiablePresentation"],
  <span class="highlight">"verifiableCredential": [{ ... }],
  "proof": [{ ... }]</span>
}
        </pre>

        <p>
The contents of the <code>verifiableCredential</code> <a>property</a> shown
above are <a>verifiable credentials</a>, as described by this specification. The
contents of the <code>proof</code> <a>property</a> are proofs, as described by
the Linked Data Proofs [[?LD-PROOFS]] specification.
        </p>

        <h4>Presentations Using Derived Credentials</h4>

        <p>
Some zero-knowledge cryptography schemes might enable <a>holders</a> to
indirectly prove they hold <a>claims</a> from a <a>verifiable credential</a>
without revealing the <a>verifiable credential</a> itself. In these schemes, a
<a>claim</a> from a <a>verifiable credential</a> might be used to derive a
presented value, which is cryptographically asserted such that a <a>verifier</a>
can trust the value if they trust the <a>issuer</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
For example, a <a>verifiable credential</a> containing the <a>claim</a>
<code>date of birth</code> might be used to derive the presented value
<code>over the age of 15</code> in a manner that is cryptographically
verifiable. That is, a <a>verifier</a> can still trust the derived value if
they trust the <a>issuer</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
For an example of a ZKP-style <a>verifiable presentation</a> containing
derived data instead of directly embedded <a>verifiable credentials</a>, see
Section <a href="#zero-knowledge-proofs"></a>.
        </p>

        <p>
Selective disclosure schemes using zero-knowledge proofs can use <a>claims</a>
expressed in this model to prove additional statements about those <a>claims</a>.
For example, a <a>claim</a> specifying a <a>subject's</a> date of birth can be
used as a predicate to prove the <a>subject's</a> age is within a given range,
and therefore prove the <a>subject</a> qualifies for age-related discounts,
without actually revealing the <a>subject's</a> birthdate. The <a>holder</a>
has the flexibility to use the <a>claim</a> in any way that is applicable to
the desired <a>verifiable presentation</a>.

      <h2>Advanced Concepts</h2>

      <p>
Building on the concepts introduced in Section <a href="#basic-concepts"></a>,
this section explores more complex topics about <a>verifiable credentials</a>.
      </p>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Lifecycle Details</h3>

        <p>
Section <a href="#ecosystem-overview"></a> provided an overview of the
<a>verifiable credential</a> ecosystem. This section provides more detail about
how the ecosystem is envisaged to operate, as follows:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
The <a>verifier</a> defines its policies for accepting
<a>verifiable credentials</a> from <a>holders</a> for its supported actions.
          </li>
          <li>
The <a>issuer</a> issues a <a>verifiable credential</a> to the <a>holder</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
The <a>holder</a> might pass on its <a>verifiable credentials</a> to another
<a>holder</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
The final <a>holder</a> presents its <a>verifiable credentials</a> to the
<a>verifier</a> in a <a>verifiable presentation</a>, requesting a supported
action.
          </li>
          <li>
The <a>verifier</a> <a>verifies</a> the authenticity of the
<a>verifiable presentation</a> and <a>verifiable credentials</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
The <a>verifier</a> <a>verifies</a> that the <a>holder</a> possesses the
<a>verifiable credentials</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
The <a>verifier</a> decides whether to accept the <a>verifiable credentials</a>
for the requested action, taking into account its policy, the <a>holder</a>,
and the contents of the <a>verifiable credentials</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
The <a>verifier</a> either performs the requested action or rejects the
request.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p class="note">
The order of the steps above are not fixed and some steps might be repeated.
        </p>

        <p>
This specification does not define any protocol for transfering
<a>verifiable credentials</a> or <a>verifiable presentations</a>, but assuming
other specifications do specify how they are transferred between entities, then
this Verifiable Credential Data Model is:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
Directly applicable to steps 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
          </li>
          <li>
Not sufficient on its own for steps 1, 7, and 8 because an authorization
framework is also needed.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
In particular, Sections <a href="#terms-of-use"></a> and
<a href="#subject-holder-relationships"></a> specify how a <a>verifier</a> can
determine:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
Whether the <a>holder</a> is a <a>subject</a> of a
<a>verifiable credential</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
The relationship between the <a>subject</a> and the <a>holder</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
Whether the original <a>holder</a> passed a <a>verifiable credential</a> to a
subsequent <a>holder</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
Any restrictions using the <a>verifiable credentials</a> by the <a>holder</a>
or <a>verifier</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="informative">
        <h2>Trust Model</h2>

        <p>
The <a>verifiable credentials</a> trust model is as follows:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
The <a>verifier</a> trusts the <a>issuer</a> to issue the <a>credential</a> that
it received. To establish this trust, a <a>credential</a> is expected to either:
            <ul>
              <li>
Include a <a href="#proofs-signatures">proof</a> establishing that the
<a>issuer</a> generated the <a>credential</a> (that is, it is a
<a>verifiable credential</a>), or
              </li>
              <li>
Have been transmitted in a way clearly establishing that the <a>issuer</a>
generated the <a>verifiable credential</a> and that the
<a>verifiable credential</a> was not tampered with in transit or storage. This
trust could be weakened depending on the risk assessment of the <a>verifier</a>.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
All <a>entities</a> trust the <a>verifiable data registry</a> to be
tamper-evident and to be a correct record of which data is controlled by which
<a>entities</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
The <a>subject</a> and <a>verifier</a> trust the <a>issuer</a> to issue
true (that is, not false) <a>credentials</a> about the <a>subject</a>, and to
revoke them quickly when appropriate.
          </li>
          <li>
The <a>holder</a> trusts the <a>repository</a> to store <a>credentials</a>
securely, to not release them to anyone other than the <a>holder</a>, and to not
corrupt or lose them while they are in its care.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
This trust model differentiates itself from other trust models by ensuring
the:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
<a>Issuer</a> and the <a>verifier</a> do not need to trust the
<a>repository</a>
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Issuer</a> does not need to know or trust the <a>verifier</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
By decoupling the trust between the <a>identity provider</a> and the
<a>relying party</a> a more flexible and dynamic trust model is created such
that market competition and customer choice is increased.
        </p>

        <p>
For more information about how this trust model interacts with various threat
models studied by the Working Group, see the Verifiable Credentials Use Cases
document [[VC-USECASES]].
        </p>

        <p class="note">
The data model detailed in this specification does not imply a transitive trust
model, such as that provided by more traditional Certificate Authority trust
models. In the Verifiable Credentials Data Model, a <a>verifier</a> either
directly trusts or does not trust an <a>issuer</a>. While it is possible to
build transitive trust models using the Verifiable Credentials Data Model,
implementers are urged to

about the security weaknesses</a> introduced by

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Extensibility</h3>

        <p>
One of the goals of the Verifiable Credentials Data Model is to enable
permissionless innovation. To achieve this, the data model needs to be
extensible in a number of different ways. The data model is required to:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
Model complex multi-entity relationships through the use of a
<a>graph</a>-based data model.
          </li>
          <li>
Extend the machine-readable vocabularies used to describe information in the
data model, without the use of a centralized system for doing so, through the
use of [[?LINKED-DATA]].
          </li>
          <li>
Support multiple types of cryptographic proof formats through the use of
Linked Data Proofs [[?LD-PROOFS]], Linked Data Signatures [[?LD-SIGNATURES]],
and a variety of signature suites.
          </li>
          <li>
Provide all of the extensibility mechanisms outlined above in a data format
that is popular with software developers and web page authors, and is enabled
through the use of [[JSON-LD]].
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
This approach to data modelling is often called an
<em>open world assumption</em>, meaning that any entity can say anything about
any other entity. While this approach seems to conflict with building simple
and predictable software systems, balancing extensibility with program
correctness is always more challenging with an open world assumption than with
closed software systems.
        </p>

        <p>
The rest of this section describes, through a series of examples, how both
extensibility and program correctness are achieved.
        </p>

        <p>
Let us assume we start with the <a>verifiable credential</a> shown below.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="A simple credential">
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1"
  ],
  "id": "http://example.com/credentials/4643",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential"],
  "issuer": "https://example.com/issuers/14",
  "issuanceDate": "2018-02-24T05:28:04Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:abcdef1234567",
    "name": "Jane Doe"
  },
  "proof": { ... }
}
        </pre>

        <p>
This <a>verifiable credential</a> states that the <a>entity</a> associated with
<code>did:example:abcdef1234567</code> has a <code>name</code> with a value of
<code>Jane Doe</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
Now let us assume a developer wants to extend the <a>verifiable credential</a>
to store two additional pieces of information: an internal corporate reference
number, and Jane's favorite food.
        </p>

        <p>
The first thing to do is to create a JSON-LD context containing two new terms,
as shown below.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="A JSON-LD context">
{
  "@context": {
    "referenceNumber": "https://example.com/vocab#referenceNumber",
    "favoriteFood": "https://example.com/vocab#favoriteFood"
  }
}
        </pre>

        <p>
After this JSON-LD context is created, the developer publishes it somewhere
so it is accessible to <a>verifiers</a> who will be processing the
<a>verifiable credential</a>. Assuming the above JSON-LD context is published
at <code>https://example.com/contexts/mycontext.jsonld</code>, we can extend
this example by including the context and adding the new <a>properties</a> and
<a>credential</a> <a>type</a> to the <a>verifiable credential</a>.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight"
          title="A verifiable credential with a custom extension">
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
    <span class="highlight">"https://example.com/contexts/mycontext.jsonld"</span>
  ],
  "id": "http://example.com/credentials/4643",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "CustomExt12"],
  "issuer": "https://example.com/issuers/14",
  "issuanceDate": "2018-02-24T05:28:04Z",
  <span class="highlight">"referenceNumber": 83294847,</span>
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:abcdef1234567",
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    <span class="highlight">"favoriteFood": "Papaya"</span>
  },
  "proof": { ... }
}
        </pre>

        <p>
This example demonstrates extending the Verifiable Credentials Data Model in a
permissionless and decentralized way. The mechanism shown also ensures that
<a>verifiable credentials</a> created in this way provide a mechanism to
prevent namespace conflicts and semantic ambiguity.
        </p>

        <p>
A dynamic extensibility model such as this does increase the implementation
burden. Software written for such a system has to determine whether
<a>verifiable credentials</a> with extensions are acceptable based on the risk
profile of the application. Some applications might accept only certain
extensions while highly secure environments might not accept any extensions.
These decisions are up to the developers of these applications and are
specifically not the domain of this specification.
        </p>

        <p>
Developers are urged to ensure that extension JSON-LD contexts are highly
available. Implementations that cannot fetch a context will produce an error.
Strategies for ensuring that extension JSON-LD contexts are always available
include using content-addressed URLs for contexts, bundling context documents
with implementations, or enabling aggressive caching of contexts.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h4>Semantic Interoperability</h4>

          <p>
This specification endeavors to enable both the JSON and JSON-LD syntaxes to
be semantically compatible with one another without the JSON implementations
needing to process the documents as JSON-LD. To achieve this, the
specification imposes the following additional restrictions on both syntaxes:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
JSON-based processors MUST process the <code>@context</code> <a>property</a>,
ensuring the expected values exist in the expected order for the
<a>credential</a> type being processed. It is advised that the expected order
of values of the <code>@context</code> <a>property</a> should be defined by
at least a human-readable extension specification and preferably by a
machine-readable specification as well.
            </li>
            <li>
JSON-LD-based processors MUST produce an error when a JSON-LD context
redefines any term in the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#dfn-active-context">active context</a>.
The only way to change the definition of existing terms is to introduce a
new term that clears the active context within the scope of that new term.
Authors that are interested in this feature should read about the
<code>@protected</code> feature in the JSON-LD 1.1 specification.
            </li>
          </ul>

        </section>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Data Schemas</h3>

        <p>
Data schemas are useful when enforcing a specific structure on a given
collection of data. There are at least two types of data schemas that this
specification considers:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
Data verification schemas, which are used to <a>verify</a> that the structure
and contents of a <a>verifiable credential</a> conform to a published schema.
          </li>
          <li>
Data encoding schemas, which are used to map the contents of a
<a>verifiable credential</a> to an alternative representation format, such as a
binary format used in a zero-knowledge proof.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
This specification defines the following <a>property</a> for the expression of
a data schema:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><var>credentialSchema</var></dt>
          <dd>
The value of the <code>credentialSchema</code> <a>property</a> MUST be one or
more data schemas that provide <a>verifiers</a> with enough information to
determine if the provided data conforms to the provided schema. Each
<code>credentialSchema</code> MUST specify its
<code>type</code> (for example, <code>JsonSchemaValidator2018</code>), and an
<code>id</code> <a>property</a> that MUST be a <a>URI</a> identifying the
schema file. The precise contents of each data schema is determined by the
specific type definition.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p class="note">
The <code>credentialSchema</code> provides an opportunity to annotate type
definitions or lock them to specific versions of the vocabulary. Authors of VCs
can include a static version of their vocabulary via credentialSchema that is
locked to some content integrity protection mechanism.
The <code>credentialSchema</code> <a>property</a> also makes it possible to
perform syntactic checking on the credential and use verification mechanisms
such as JSON Schema validation.
        </p>

        <p>
In the example above, the <a>issuer</a> is specifying a
<code>credentialSchema</code>, which points to a [[?JSON-SCHEMA]] file that can
be used by a <a>verifier</a> to determine if the <a>verifiable credential</a> is
well formed.
        </p>

        <p class="note" >
For information about linkages to JSON Schema or other optional
<a>verification</a> mechanisms, see the [[VC-IMP-GUIDE]].
        </p>

        <p>
Data schemas can also be used to specify mappings to other binary formats, such
as those used to perform zero-knowledge proofs. For more information on using

which can then be used by a <a>verifier</a> to determine if the proof provided
with the <a>verifiable credential</a> is valid.

        <h3>Refreshing</h3>

        <p>
It is useful for systems to enable the manual or automatic refresh of an
<a href="#expiration">expired</a> <a>verifiable credential</a>. This
specification enables an <a>issuer</a> to include a link to a refresh service.
        </p>
        <p>
The <a>issuer</a> can include the refresh service as an element inside the
<a>verifiable credential</a> if it is intended for either the <a>verifier</a>
or the <a>holder</a> (or both), or inside the <a>verifiable presentation</a>
if it is intended for the <a>holder</a> only. In the latter case, this enables
the <a>holder</a> to refresh the <a>verifiable credential</a> before creating
a <a>verifiable presentation</a> to share with a <a>verifier</a>. In the former case,
including the refresh service inside the <a>verifiable credential</a> enables both
the <a>holder</a> and the <a>verifier</a> to perform future updates of the credential.
        </p>
        <p>
The refresh service is only expected to be used when either the <a>credential</a>
has expired, or when the <a>issuer</a> does not publish <a>credential</a> status
information. <a>Issuers</a> are advised not to put the <code>refreshService</code>
in a <a>verifiable credential</a> that does not contain public information, or
whose refresh service is not protected in some way.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
Placing a <code>refreshService</code> in a <a>verifiable credential</a> so that
it is available to <a>verifiers</a> can remove control and consent from the
<a>holder</a> and allow the <a>verifiable credential</a> to be issued directly
to the <a>verifier</a>, thereby bypassing the <a>holder</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
This specification defines the following <a>property</a> for expressing
a refresh service:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><var>refreshService</var></dt>
          <dd>
The value of the <code>refreshService</code> <a>property</a> MUST be one or
more refresh services that provides enough information to the recipient's
software such that the recipient can refresh the <a>verifiable credential</a>.
Each <code>refreshService</code> value MUST specify its <code>type</code> (for
example, <code>ManualRefreshService2018</code>) and its
<code>id</code>, which is the URL of the service. The precise content of each
refresh service is determined by the specific <code>refreshService</code>
<a>type</a> definition.

        <h3>Terms of Use</h3>

        <p>
Terms of use can be utilized by an <a>issuer</a> or a <a>holder</a> to
communicate the terms under which a <a>verifiable credential</a> or
<a>verifiable presentation</a> was issued. The <a>issuer</a> places their terms
of use inside the <a>verifiable credential</a>. The <a>holder</a> places their
terms of use inside a <a>verifiable presentation</a>. The value of this property
tells the <a>verifier</a> what actions it is required to perform (an
<em>obligation</em>), not allowed to perform (a <em>prohibition</em>), or
allowed perform (a <em>permission</em>) if it is to accept the
<a>verifiable credential</a> or <a>verifiable presentation</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
Further study is required to determine how a <a>subject</a> who is not a
<a>holder</a> places terms of use on their <a>verifiable credentials</a>. One
way could be for the <a>subject</a> to request the <a>issuer</a> to place the
terms of use inside the issued <a>verifiable credentials</a>. Another way
could be for the <a>subject</a> to delegate a <a>verifiable credential</a> to
a <a>holder</a> and placing terms of use restrictions on the delegated
<a>verifiable credential</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
This specification defines the following <a>property</a> for expressing
terms of use:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><var>termsOfUse</var></dt>
          <dd>
The value of the <code>termsOfUse</code> <a>property</a> MUST
specify one or more terms of use policies under which the creator issued the
<a>credential</a> or <a>presentation</a>. If the recipient (a <a>holder</a> or
<a>verifier</a>) is not willing to adhere to the specified terms of use, then
they do so on their own responsibility and might incur legal liability if they
violate the stated terms of use. Each <code>termsOfUse</code> value MUST specify
its <a>type</a>, for example, <code>IssuerPolicy</code>, and MAY specify its
instance <code>id</code>. The precise contents of each term of use is determined
by the specific <code>termsOfUse</code> <a>type</a> definition.

        <h3>Evidence</h3>

        <p>
Evidence can be included by an <a>issuer</a> to provide the <a>verifier</a>
with additional supporting information in a <a>verifiable credential</a>. This
could be used by the <a>verifier</a> to establish the confidence with which it
relies on the claims in the <a>verifiable credential</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
For example, an <a>issuer</a> could check physical documentation provided by the
<a>subject</a> or perform a set of background checks before issuing the
<a>credential</a>. In certain scenarios, this information is useful to the
<a>verifier</a> when determining the risk associated with relying on a given

        <h3>Zero-Knowledge Proofs</h3>

        <p>
A zero-knowledge proof is a cryptographic method where an entity can prove
to another entity that they know a certain value without disclosing the
actual value. A real-world example is proving that an accredited university
has granted a degree to you without revealing your identity or any other
personally identifiable information contained on the degree.
        </p>
        <p>
The key capabilities introduced by zero-knowledge proof mechanisms are the
ability of a <a>holder</a> to:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
Combine multiple <a>verifiable credentials</a> from multiple <a>issuers</a> into
a single <a>verifiable presentation</a> without revealing
<a>verifiable credential</a> or <a>subject</a> identifiers to the
<a>verifier</a>. This makes it more difficult for the <a>verifier</a> to collude
with any of the issuers regarding the issued <a>verifiable credentials</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
Selectively disclose the claims in a <a>verifiable credential</a> to a
<a>verifier</a> without requiring the issuance of multiple atomic
<a>verifiable credentials</a>. This allows a <a>holder</a> to provide a
<a>verifier</a> with precisely the information they need and nothing more.
          </li>
          <li>
Produce a derived <a>verifiable credential</a> that is formatted according to
the <a>verifier's</a> data schema instead of the <a>issuer's</a>, without
needing to involve the <a>issuer</a> after <a>verifiable credential</a>
issuance. This provides a great deal of flexibility for <a>holders</a> to use
their issued <a>verifiable credentials</a>.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
This specification describes a data model that supports zero-knowledge proof
mechanisms. The examples below highlight how the data model can be used to
issue, present, and verify zero-knowledge <a>verifiable credentials</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
To use zero-knowledge <a>verifiable credentials</a> the <a>issuer</a> must
issue a <a>verifiable credential</a> in a manner that enables the <a>holder</a>
to present the information to a <a>verifier</a> in a privacy-enhancing manner.
This implies that the <a>holder</a> can prove the validity of the
<a>issuer's</a> signature without revealing the values that were signed, or when
only revealing certain selected values. The standard practice is to do so by
proving knowledge of the signature, without revealing the signature itself.
There are two requirements for <a>verifiable credentials</a> when they are
to be used in zero-knowledge proof systems. The <a>verifiable credential</a>
MUST contain a:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
<a>Verifiable credential</a> definition that can be used by all parties to
perform various cryptographic operations in zero-knowledge.
          </li>
          <li>
Proof that enables <a>verifiable presentations</a> to be derived that prove
information contained in the original <a>verifiable credential</a> in
zero-knowledge. The zero-knowledge <a>verifiable presentation</a> must not
reveal any information not intended to be revealed by the <a>holder</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
The following example shows one method of using <a>verifiable credentials</a>
in zero-knowledge. It makes use of a CL Signature, which allows the presentation
of the <a>verifiable credential</a> in a way that supports the privacy of the
<a>holder</a> and <a>subject</a> through the use of selective disclosure of the
<a>verifiable credential</a> values.

The example above provides the <a>verifiable credential</a> definition by using
the <code>credentialSchema</code> <a>property</a> and a specific proof that is
usable in the Camenisch-Lysyanskaya Zero-Knowledge Proof system.
        </p>

        <p>
The next example utilizes the <a>verifiable credential</a> above to generate a
new derived <a>verifiable credential</a> with a privacy-preserving proof. The
derived <a>verifiable credential</a> is then placed in a
<a>verifiable presentation</a>, which further proves that the entire assertion
is valid. There are three requirements of most <a>verifiable presentations</a>
when they are to be used in zero-knowledge systems:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
All derived <a>verifiable credentials</a> MUST contain a reference to the
<a>verifiable credential</a> definition used to generate the derived proof.
          </li>
          <li>
All derived proofs in <a>verifiable credentials</a> MUST NOT leak information
that would enable the <a>verifier</a> to correlate the <a>holder</a> presenting
the <a>verifiable credential</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
The <a>verifiable presentation</a> MUST contain a proof enabling the
<a>verifier</a> to ascertain that all <a>verifiable credentials</a> in the
<a>verifiable presentation</a> were issued to the same <a>holder</a> without
leaking personally identifiable information that the <a>holder</a> did not
intend to share.

        <h3>Disputes</h3>

        <p>
There are at least two different cases to consider for an <a>entity</a>
wanting to dispute a <a>credential</a> issued by an <a>issuer</a>:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
A <a>subject</a> disputes a claim made by the <a>issuer</a>. For example, the
<code>address</code> <a>property</a> is incorrect or out of date.
          </li>
          <li>
An <a>entity</a> disputes a potentially false claim made by the <a>issuer</a>
about a different <a>subject</a>. For example, an imposter claims the social
security number for an <a>entity</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
Only a <a>subject</a> of a <a>verifiable credential</a> is entitled to issue
a <code>DisputeCredential</code>. A <code>DisputeCredential</code> issued by
anyone other than the <a>subject</a> should be disregarded by the
<a>verifier</a>, unless the <a>verifier</a> has some other way of determining
the truth of the dispute. This is to prevent denial of service attacks whereby
an attacker falsely disputes a true claim.
        </p>

        <p>
The mechanism for issuing a <code>DisputeCredential</code> is the same as
for a regular <a>credential</a> except that the <code>credentialSubject</code>
identifier in the <code>DisputeCredential</code> property is the identifier of
the disputed <a>credential</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
For example, if a <a>credential</a> with an identifier of
<code>https://example.org/credentials/245</code> is disputed, an <a>entity</a>
can issue one of the <a>credentials</a> shown below. In the first example, the
<a>subject</a> might present this to the <a>verifier</a> along with the disputed
<a>credential</a>. In the second example, the <a>entity</a> might publish the
<code>DisputeCredential</code> in a public venue to make it known that the
<a>credential</a> is disputed.
        </p>

<p> In the above <a>verifiable credential</a> the <a>issuer</a> is claiming that
the address in the disputed <a>verifiable credential</a> is wrong. For example,
the <a>subject</a> might wrongly be claiming to have the same address as that of
the <a>issuer</a>.
</p>
        <p class="note">
If a <a>credential</a> does not have an identifier, a content-addressed
identifier can be used to identify the disputed <a>credential</a>. Similarly,
content-addressed identifiers can be used to uniquely identify individual
claims.
        </p>

        <p class="issue atrisk">
The dispute feature may change significantly during the W3C Candidate
Recommendation process including possibly being removed if there is not enough
support from implementations for the feature.

        <h3>Authorization</h3>

        <p>
<a>Verifiable credentials</a> are intended as a means of reliably identifying
<a>subjects</a>. While it is recognized that Role Based Access Controls (RBACs)
and Attribute Based Access Controls (ABACs) rely on this identification as a
means of authorizing <a>subjects</a> to access resources, this specification
does not provide a complete solution for RBAC or ABAC. Authorization is not an
appropriate use for this specification without an accompanying authorization
framework.
        </p>

        <p>
The Working Group did consider authorization use cases during the creation of
this specification and is pursuing that work as an architectural layer built
on top of this specification.

    <section>
      <h2>Syntaxes</h2>

      <p>

The data model as described in Sections
<a href="#core-data-model"></a>, <a href="#basic-concepts"></a>, and
<a href="#advanced-concepts"></a> is the canonical structural
representation of a <a>verifiable credential</a> or <a>verifiable presentation</a>.
All serializations are representations of that data model in a specific
format. This section specifies how the data model is realized in JSON-LD and plain JSON.
Although syntactic mappings are provided for only these two syntaxes, applications and
services can use any other data representation syntax (such as XML, YAML, or
CBOR) that is capable of expressing the data model. As the verification and
validation requirements are defined in terms of the data model, all serialization
syntaxes have to be deterministically translated to the data model for processing,
validation, or comparison. This specification makes no requirements for support
of any specific serialization format.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>JSON</h3>

        <p>
The data model, as described in Section <a href="#core-data-model"></a>, can be
encoded in Javascript Object Notation (JSON) [[!RFC8259]] by mapping property
values to JSON types as follows:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
Numeric values representable as IEEE754 SHOULD be represented as a Number type.
          </li>
          <li>
Boolean values SHOULD be represented as a Boolean type.
          </li>
          <li>
Sequence value SHOULD be represented as an Array type.
          </li>
          <li>
Unordered sets of values SHOULD be represented as an Array type.
          </li>
          <li>
Sets of <a>properties</a> SHOULD be represented as an Object type.
          </li>
          <li>
Empty values SHOULD be represented as a null value.
          </li>
          <li>
Other values MUST be represented as a String type.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="note">
As the transformations listed herein have potentially incompatible interpretations,
additional profiling of the JSON format is required to provide a deterministic
transformation to the data model.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>JSON-LD</h3>

        <p>
[[!JSON-LD]] is a JSON-based format used to serialize
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ld-glossary/#linked-data">Linked Data</a>. The
syntax is designed to easily integrate into deployed systems already using
JSON, and provides a smooth upgrade path from JSON to [[!JSON-LD]]. It is
primarily intended to be a way to use Linked Data in Web-based programming
environments, to build interoperable Web services, and to store Linked Data in
JSON-based storage engines.
        </p>

        <p>
[[!JSON-LD]] is useful when extending the data model described in this
specification. Instances of the data model are encoded in [[!JSON-LD]] in the
same way they are encoded in JSON (Section <a href="#json"></a>), with the
addition of the <code>@context</code> <a>property</a>. The
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#the-context">JSON-LD context</a>
is described in detail in the [[!JSON-LD]] specification and its use is
elaborated on in Section <a href="#extensibility"></a>.
        </p>

        <p>
Multiple contexts MAY be used or combined to express any arbitrary information
about <a>verifiable credentials</a> in idiomatic JSON. The
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#the-context">JSON-LD context</a>,
available at <code>https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1</code>, is a static
document that is never updated and can therefore be downloaded and cached client
side. The associated vocabulary document for the Verifiable Credentials Data
Model is available at <code>https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials</code>.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Syntactic Sugar</h3>

          <p>
In general, the data model and syntaxes described in this document are
designed such that developers can copy and paste examples to incorporate
<a>verifiable credentials</a> into their software systems. The design goal of
this approach is to provide a low barrier to entry while still ensuring global
interoperability between a heterogeneous set of software systems. This section
describes some of these approaches, which will likely go unnoticed by most
developers, but whose details will be of interest to implementers. The most
noteworthy syntactic sugars provided by [[!JSON-LD]] are:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
The <code>@id</code> and <code>@type</code> keywords are aliased to
<code>id</code> and <code>type</code> respectively, enabling developers to use
this specification as idiomatic JSON.
            </li>
            <li>
Data types, such as integers, dates, units of measure, and URLs, are
automatically typed to provide stronger type guarantees for use cases that
require them.
            </li>
            <li>
The <code>verifiableCredential</code> and <code>proof</code> <a>properties</a>
are treated as <em>graph containers</em>. That is, mechanisms used to isolate
sets of data asserted by different entities. This ensures, for example, proper
cryptographic separation between the data graph provided by each <a>issuer</a>
and the one provided by the <a>holder</a> presenting the
<a>verifiable credential</a> to ensure the provenance of the information for
each graph is preserved.
            </li>
            <li>
The <code>@protected</code> properties feature of [[!JSON-LD]] 1.1 is used to
ensure that terms defined by this specification cannot be overridden. This means
that as long as the same <code>@context</code> declaration is made at the top of
a <a>verifiable credential</a> or <a>verifiable presentation</a>,
interoperability is guaranteed for all terms understood by users of the data
model whether or not they use a [[!JSON-LD]] processor.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Proof Formats</h2>

        <p>
The data model described in this specification is designed to be proof format
agnostic. This specification does not normatively require any particular digital
proof or signature format. While the data model is the canonical representation
of a <a>verifiable credential</a> or <a>verifiable presentation</a>, the proofing mechanisms
for these are often tied to the syntax used
in the transmission of the document between parties. As such, each proofing
mechanism has to specify whether the validation of the proof is calculated
against the state of the document as transmitted, against the transformed
data model, or another form. At the time of publication, at least two proof
formats are being actively utilized by implementers and the Working Group felt
that documenting what these proof formats are and how they are being used would
be beneficial to implementers. The sections detailing the current proof formats
being actively utilized to issue <a>verifiable credentials</a> are:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Section <a href="#json-web-token"></a>, and</li>
          <li>Section <a href="#linked-data-proofs"></a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <section>
          <h3>JSON Web Token</h3>

          <p>
JSON Web Token (JWT) [[!RFC7519]] is still a widely used means to express
<a>claims</a> to be transferred between two parties. Providing a representation
of the Verifiable Credentials Data Model for JWT allows existing systems and
libraries to participate in the ecosystem described in Section
<a href="#ecosystem-overview"></a>. A JWT encodes a set of <a>claims</a> as a
JSON object that is contained in a JSON Web Signature (JWS) [[!RFC7515]] or JWE
[[!RFC7516]]. For this specification, the use of JWE is out of scope.
          </p>

          <p class="issue atrisk">
JWT support is a feature at risk and may be removed during the W3C Candidate
Recommendation phase if there is not enough implementer support for the
feature.
          </p>

          <section>
            <h4>Relation to the Verifiable Credentials Data Model</h4>

            <p>
This specification defines encoding rules of the Verifiable Credential Data
Model onto JWT and JWS. It further defines processing rules how and when to make
use of specific JWT-registered <a>claim</a> names and specific JWS-registered
header parameter names to allow systems based on JWT to comply with this
specification. If these specific <a>claim</a> names and header parameters are
present, their respective counterpart in the standard
<a>verifiable credential</a> and <a>verifiable presentation</a> MAY be omitted
to avoid duplication.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h4>IANA Considerations</h4>

            <p>
This specification introduces two new registered <a>claim</a> names, which
contain those parts of the standard <a>verifiable credentials</a> and
<a>verifiable presentation</a> where no explicit encoding rules for JWT exist.
These objects are enclosed in the JWT payload as follows:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
<code>vc</code>: JSON object, which MUST be present in a JWT
<a>verifiable credential</a>. The object contains the
<a>verifiable credential</a> according to this specification.
              </li>
              <li>
<code>vp</code>: JSON object, which MUST be present in a JWT
<a>verifiable presentation</a>. The object contains the
<a>verifiable presentation</a> according to this specification.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h4>JWT and JWS Considerations</h4>

            <section>
              <h5>JWT Encoding</h5>
            <p>
To encode a <a>verifiable credential</a> as a JWT, specific
<a>properties</a> introduced by this specification MUST be encoded as standard
JOSE header parameters, JWT registered <a>claim</a> names, or contained in the
JWS signature part. If no explicit rule is specified, <a>properties</a> are
encoded in the same way as with a standard <a>verifiable credential</a>, and are
added to the <code>vc</code> <a>property</a> of the JWT. As with all JWTs,
the JWS-based signature of a <a>verifiable credential</a> represented in the JWT syntax is
calculated against the literal JWT string value as presented across the wire, before any
decoding or transformation rules are applied. The following paragraphs describe
these encoding rules.
            </p>

            <p>
If the JWS is present, the digital signature either refers to the <a>issuer</a>
of the <a>verifiable credential</a>, or in the case of a
<a>verifiable presentation</a>, the <a>holder</a> of the
<a>verifiable credential</a>. The JWS proves that the <a>issuer</a> of the JWT
signed the contained JWT payload and therefore, the <code>proof</code>
<a>property</a> can be omitted.
            </p>

            <p>
If no JWS is present, a <code>proof</code> <a>property</a> MUST be provided.
The <code>proof</code> <a>property</a> can be used to represent more complex
proofs, for example if the creator is different from the <a>issuer</a>, or a
proof not based on digital signatures, such as Proof of Work. The <a>issuer</a>
MAY include both a JWS and a <code>proof</code> <a>property</a>. For backward
compatibility reasons, the issuer MUST use JWS to represent proofs based on a
digital signature.
            </p>

            <p>
The following defines rules for JOSE headers in the context of this
specification:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
<code>alg</code> MUST be used for RSA and ECDSA-based digital signatures. If
only the <code>proof</code> attribute is used, the <code>alg</code> header MUST
be set to <code>none</code>.
              </li>
              <li>
<code>kid</code> MAY be used if there are multiple keys associated with the
<a>issuer</a> of the JWT. The key discovery is out of the scope of this
specification. For example, the <code>kid</code> can refer to a key in a
<a>DID document</a>, or can be the identifier of a key inside a JWKS.
              </li>
              <li>
<code>typ</code>, if present, MUST be set to <code>JWT</code>.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
For backward compatibility with JWT processors, the following JWT-registered
claim names MUST be used instead of, or in addition to, their respective
standard <a>verifiable credential</a> counterparts:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
<code>exp</code> MUST represent <code>expirationDate</code>, encoded as a UNIX
timestamp (<code>NumericDate</code>).
              </li>
              <li>
<code>iss</code> MUST represent the <code>issuer</code> <a>property</a>.
              </li>
              <li>
<code>iat</code> MUST represent <code>issuanceDate</code>, encoded as a UNIX
timestamp (<code>NumericDate</code>).
              </li>
              <li>
<code>jti</code> MUST represent the <code>id</code> <a>property</a> of the
<a>verifiable credential</a>.
              </li>
              <li>
<code>sub</code> MUST represent the <code>id</code> <a>property</a> contained
in the <a>verifiable credential</a> <a>subject</a>.
              </li>
              <li>
<code>aud</code> MUST represent the <code>subject</code> of the consumer of the
<a>verifiable presentation</a>.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
Other JOSE header parameters and <a>claim</a> names not specified herein can be
used if their use is not explicitly discouraged. Additional <a>claims</a> MUST
be added to the <code>credentialSubject</code> <a>property</a> of the JWT.
            </p>

            <p>
This version of the specification defines no JWT-specific encoding rules for
the concepts outlined in Section
<a href="#advanced-concepts">Advanced Concepts</a> (for example,
<code>refreshService</code>, <code>termsOfUse</code>, and
<code>evidence</code>). These concepts can be encoded as they are without any
transformation, and can be added to the <code>vc</code> <a>property</a> of the
JWT.
            </p>

            </section>

            <section>
              <h5>JWT Decoding</h5>

            <p>
To decode a JWT to a standard <a>verifiable credential</a>, the following
transformation MUST be performed:
            </p>

              <ol>
                  <li>
Create a JSON object.
                  </li>
                  <li>
Add the content from the <code>vc</code> property to the new JSON object.
                  </li>
                  <li>

          <h3>Linked Data Proofs</h3>

          <p>
This specification utilizes Linked Data to publish information on the Web
using standards, such as URLs and JSON-LD, to identify <a>subjects</a> and
their associated properties. When information is presented in this manner,
other related information can be easily discovered and new information can be
easily merged into the existing graph of knowledge. Linked Data is
extensible in a decentralized way, greatly reducing barriers to large scale
integration. The data model in this specification works well with the
<a href="https://w3c-dvcg.github.io/ld-proofs/">Linked Data Proofs</a>,
<a href="https://w3c-dvcg.github.io/ld-signatures/">Linked Data Signatures</a>,
and the associated
<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-cryptosuite-registry/">Linked Data Cryptographic Suites</a>,
which are designed to protect the data model as described by this specification.
          </p>

          <p>
Unlike the use of JSON Web Token, no extra pre- or post-processing is necessary.
The Linked Data Proofs format was designed to simply and easily protect
<a>verifiable credentials</a> and <a>verifiable presentations</a>. Protecting
a <a>verifiable credential</a> or <a>verifiable presentation</a> is as simple
as passing a valid example in this specification to a Linked Data Signatures
implementation and generating a digital signature.
          </p>

          <p class="note">
Information on the different qualities of the various syntax formats,
e.g. JSON+JWT, JSON-LD+JWT, and JSON-LD+LD-Proofs may be found in the
[[VC-IMP-GUIDE]].

    <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

    <p>
This section details the general privacy considerations and specific privacy
implications of deploying the Verifiable Credentials Data Model into production
environments.
    </p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Spectrum of Privacy</h3>

      <p>
It is important to recognize there is a spectrum of privacy ranging from
pseudonymous to strongly identified. Depending on the use case, people have
different comfort levels about what information they are willing to provide
and what information can be derived from what is provided.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img style="margin: auto; display: block; width: 80%;"
          src="diagrams/privacy-spectrum.svg" alt="Horizontal bar with
          red on the left, orange in the middle, and green on the
          right.  The red has the text 'Highly correlatable (global
          IDs), e.g. government ID, shipping address, credit card
          number'.  The orange has the text 'Correlatable ia collusion
          (personally identifiable info), e.g. name, birthday, zip
          code'.  The green has the text 'Non-correlatable
          (pseudonyms), e.g. age over 21'.">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
Privacy spectrum ranging from pseudonymous to fully identified.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
For example, most people probably want to remain anonymous when purchasing
alcohol because the regulatory check required is solely based on whether a
person is above a specific age. Alternatively, for medical prescriptions
written by a doctor for a patient, the pharmacy fulfilling the prescription is
required to more strongly identify the medical professional and the patient.
Therefore there is not one approach to privacy that works for all use cases.
Privacy solutions are use case specific.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
Even for those wanting to remain anonymous when purchasing alcohol, photo
identification might still be required to provide appropriate assurance to the
merchant. The merchant might not need to know your name or other details (other
than that you are over a specific age), but in many cases just proof of age
might still be insufficient to meet regulations.
      </p>

      <p>
The Verifiable Credentials Data Model strives to support the full privacy
spectrum and does not take philosophical positions on the correct level of
anonymity for any specific transaction. The following sections provide guidance
for implementers who want to avoid specific scenarios that are hostile to
privacy.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>

      <p>
Data associated with <a>verifiable credentials</a> stored in the
<code>credential.credentialSubject</code> field is susceptible to privacy
violations when shared with <a>verifiers</a>. Personally identifying data, such
as a government-issued identifier, shipping address, and full name, can be
easily used to determine, track, and correlate an <a>entity</a>. Even
information that does not seem personally identifiable, such as the
combination of a birthdate and a postal code, has very powerful correlation
and de-anonymizing capabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
Implementers are strongly advised to warn <a>holders</a> when they share data
with these kinds of characteristics. <a>Issuers</a> are strongly advised to
provide privacy-protecting <a>verifiable credentials</a> when possible. For
example, issuing <code>ageOver</code> <a>verifiable credentials</a> instead of
date of birth <a>verifiable credentials</a> when a <a>verifier</a> wants to
determine if an <a>entity</a> is over the age of 18.
      </p>

      <p>
Because a <a>verifiable credential</a> often contains PII, implementers are
strongly advised to use mechanisms while storing and transporting
<a>verifiable credentials</a> that protect the data from those who should not
access it. Mechanisms that could be considered include TLS or other means of
encrypting the data while it is being transported, as well as encryption or data
access control mechanisms to protect the data in a <a>verifiable credential</a>
while at rest.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Identifier-Based Correlation</h3>

      <p>
<a>Subjects</a> of <a>verifiable credentials</a> are identified using the
<code>credential.credentialSubject.id</code> field. The identifiers used to
identify a <a>subject</a> create a greater risk of correlation when the
identifiers are long-lived or used across more than one web domain.
      </p>

      <p>
Similarly, disclosing the <a>credential</a> identifier
(<code>credential.id</code>) leads to situations where multiple
<a>verifiers</a>, or an <a>issuer</a> and a <a>verifier</a>, can collude to
correlate the <a>holder</a>. If <a>holders</a> want to reduce correlation, they
should use <a>verifiable credential</a> schemes that allow hiding the
identifier during <a>verifiable presentation</a>. Such schemes expect the
<a>holder</a> to generate the identifier and might even allow hiding the
identifier from the <a>issuer</a>, while still keeping the identifier embedded
and signed in the <a>verifiable credential</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
If strong anti-correlation properties are a requirement in a
<a>verifiable credentials</a> system, it is strongly advised that identifiers
are either:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
Bound to a single origin
        </li>
        <li>
Single-use
        </li>
        <li>
Not used at all, but instead replaced by short-lived, single-use bearer tokens.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Signature-Based Correlation</h3>

      <p>
The contents of <a>verifiable credentials</a> are secured using the
<code>credential.proof</code> field. The <a>properties</a> in this field
create a greater risk of correlation when the same values are used across more
than one session or domain and the value does not change. Examples include the
<code>creator</code>, <code>created</code>, <code>domain</code> (for very
specific domains), <code>nonce</code>, and <code>signatureValue</code> fields.
      </p>

      <p>
If strong anti-correlation properties are required, it is advised that
signature values and metadata are regenerated each time using technologies like
third-party pairwise signatures, zero-knowledge proofs, or group signatures.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
Even when using anti-correlation signatures, information might still be
contained in a <a>verifiable credential</a> that defeats the anti-correlation
properties of the cryptography used.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Long-Lived Identifier-Based Correlation</h3>

      <p>
<a>Verifiable credentials</a> might contain long-lived identifiers that could
be used to correlate individuals. These types of identifiers include
<a>subject</a> identifiers, email addresses, government-issued identifiers,
organization-issued identifiers, addresses, healthcare vitals,
<a>verifiable credential</a>-specific JSON-LD contexts, and many other sorts of
long-lived identifiers.
      </p>

      <p>
Organizations providing software to <a>holders</a> should strive to identify
fields in <a>verifiable credentials</a> containing information that could be
used to correlate individuals and warn <a>holders</a> when this information is
shared.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Device Fingerprinting</h3>

      <p>
There are mechanisms external to <a>verifiable credentials</a> that are used to
track and correlate individuals on the Internet and the Web. Some of these
mechanisms include Internet protocol (IP) address tracking, web browser
fingerprinting, evercookies, advertising network trackers, mobile network
position information, and in-application Global Positioning System (GPS) APIs.
Using <a>verifiable credentials</a> cannot prevent the use of these other
tracking technologies. Also, when these technologies are used in conjunction
with <a>verifiable credentials</a>, new correlatable information could be
discovered. For example, a birthday coupled with a GPS position can be used to
strongly correlate an individual across multiple websites.
      </p>

      <p>
It is recommended that privacy-respecting systems prevent the use of these
other tracking technologies when <a>verifiable credentials</a> are being used.
In some cases, tracking technologies might need to be disabled on devices that
transmit <a>verifiable credentials</a> on behalf of a <a>holder</a>.

      <h3>Favor Abstract Claims</h3>

      <p>
To enable recipients of <a>verifiable credentials</a> to use them in a variety
of circumstances without revealing more personally identifiable information
than necessary for transactions, <a>issuers</a> should consider limiting the
information published in a <a>credential</a> to a minimal set needed for the
expected purposes. One way to avoid placing personally identifiable
information in a <a>credential</a> is to use an abstract <a>property</a> that
meets the needs of <a>verifiers</a> without providing specific information about
a <a>subject</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
For example, this document uses the <code>ageOver</code> <a>property</a>
instead of a specific birthdate, which constitutes much stronger personally
identifiable information. If retailers in a specific market commonly require
purchasers to be older than a certain age, an <a>issuer</a> trusted in that
market might choose to offer a <a>verifiable credential</a> claiming that
<a>subjects</a> have met that requirement instead of offering
<a>verifiable credentials</a> containing <a>claims</a> about specific
birthdates. This enables individual customers to make purchases without
revealing specific personally identifiable information.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>The Principle of Data Minimization</h3>

      <p>
Privacy violations occur when information divulged in one context leaks into
another. Accepted best practice for preventing such violations is to limit the
information requested, and received, to the absolute minimum necessary. This
data minimization approach is required by regulation in multiple
jurisdictions, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act (HIPAA) in the United States and the General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) in the European Union.
      </p>
      <p>
With <a>verifiable credentials</a>, data minimization for <a>issuers</a> means
limiting the content of a <a>verifiable credential</a> to the minimum required
by potential <a>verifiers</a> for expected use. For <a>verifiers</a>, data
minimization means limiting the scope of the information requested or
required for accessing services.
      </p>
      <p>
For example, a driver's license containing a driver's ID number, height,
weight, birthday, and home address is a <a>credential</a> containing more
information than is necessary to establish that the person is above a certain
age.
      </p>

      <p>
It is considered best practice for <a>issuers</a> to atomize information or use
a signature scheme that allows for <a>selective disclosure</a>. For example, an
<a>issuer</a> of driver's licenses could issue a <a>verifiable credential</a>
containing every attribute that appears on a driver's license, as well as a set
of <a>verifiable credentials</a> where every <a>verifiable credential</a>
contains only a single attribute such as a person's birthday. It could also
issue more abstract <a>verifiable credentials</a> (for example, a
<a>verifiable credential</a> containing only an <code>ageOver</code> attribute).
One possible adaptation would be for <a>issuers</a> to provide secure HTTP
endpoints for retrieving single-use <a>bearer credentials</a> that promote the
pseudonymous usage of <a>verifiable credentials</a>. Implementers that find this
impractical or unsafe, should consider using <a>selective disclosure</a> schemes
that eliminate dependence on <a>issuers</a> at proving time and reduce temporal
correlation risk from <a>issuers</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
<a>Verifiers</a> are urged to only request information that is absolutely
necessary for a specific transaction to occur. This is important for at
least two reasons. It:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
Reduces the liability on the <a>verifier</a> for handling highly sensitive
information that it does not need to.
        </li>
        <li>
Enhances the privacy of the individual by only asking for information required
for a specific transaction.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="note">
While it is possible to practice the Principle of Minimum Disclosure, it might
be impossible to avoid the strong identification of an individual for
specific use cases during a single session or over multiple sessions. The
authors of this document cannot stress how difficult it is to meet this
principle in real-world scenarios.

      <h3>Bearer Credentials</h3>

      <p>
A <dfn data-lt="bearer credentials">bearer credential</dfn> is a
privacy-enhancing piece of information, such as a concert ticket, which entitles
the <a>holder</a> of the bearer credential to a specific resource without
divulging sensitive information about the <a>holder</a>. Bearer credentials are
often used in low-risk use cases where the sharing of the bearer credential is
not a concern or would not result in large economic or reputational losses.
      </p>

      <p>
<a>Verifiable credentials</a> that are <a>bearer credentials</a> are made
possible by not specifying the <a>subject</a> identifier, expressed using the
<code>id</code> <a>property</a>, which is nested in the
<code>credentialSubject</code> <a>property</a>. For example, the following
<a>verifiable credential</a> is a <a>bearer credential</a>:
      </p>

      <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Usage of issuer properties">
{
  "@context": [

      "name": "&lt;span lang='fr-CA'>Baccalauréat en musiques numériques&lt;/span>"
    }
  },
  "proof": { ... }
}
      </pre>

      <p>
While <a>bearer credentials</a> can be privacy-enhancing, they must be
carefully crafted so as not accidentally divulge more information than the
<a>holder</a> of the <a>bearer credential</a> expects. For example, repeated use
of the same <a>bearer credential</a> across multiple sites enables these sites
to potentially collude to unduly track or correlate the <a>holder</a>. Likewise,
information that might seem non-identifying, such as a birthdate and postal
code, can be used to statistically identify an individual when used together in
the same <a>bearer credential</a> or session.
      </p>

      <p>
<a>Issuers</a> of <a>bearer credentials</a> should ensure that the
<a>bearer credentials</a> provide privacy-enhancing benefits that:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
Are single-use, where possible
        </li>
        <li>
Do not contain personally identifying information
        </li>
        <li>
Are not unduly correlatable.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
<a>Holders</a> should be warned by their software if <a>bearer credentials</a>
containing sensitive information are issued or requested, or if there is a
correlation risk when combining two or more <a>bearer credentials</a> across one
or more sessions. While it might be impossible to detect all correlation risks,
some might certainly be detectable.
      </p>

      <p>
<a>Verifiers</a> should not request <a>bearer credentials</a> that can be used
to unduly correlate the <a>holder</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Validity Checks</h3>

      <p>
When processing <a>verifiable credentials</a>, <a>verifiers</a> are expected to
perform many of the checks listed in Appendix <a href="#validation"></a> as
well as a variety of specific business process checks. Validity checks might
include checking:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
The professional licensure status of the <a>holder</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
A date of license renewal or revocation.
        </li>
        <li>
The sub-qualifications of an individual.
        </li>
        <li>
If a relationship exists between the <a>holder</a> and the <a>entity</a>
with whom the <a>holder</a> is attempting to interact.
        </li>
        <li>
The geolocation information associated with the <a>holder</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
The process of performing these checks might result in information leakage that
leads to a privacy violation of the <a>holder</a>. For example, a simple
operation such as checking a revocation list can notify the <a>issuer</a> that a
specific business is likely interacting with the <a>holder</a>. This could
enable <a>issuers</a> to collude and correlate individuals without their
knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
<a>Issuers</a> are urged to not use mechanisms, such as
<a>credential</a> revocation lists that are unique per <a>credential</a>, during
the <a>verification</a> process that could lead to privacy violations.
Organizations providing software to <a>holders</a> should warn when
<a>credentials</a> include information that could lead to privacy violations
during the verification process. <a>Verifiers</a> should consider rejecting
<a>credentials</a> that produce privacy violations or that enable bad privacy
practices.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Storage Providers and Data Mining</h3>

      <p>
When a <a>holder</a> receives a <a>verifiable credential</a> from an
<a>issuer</a>, the <a>verifiable credential</a> needs to be stored somewhere
(for example, in a <a>credential</a> repository). <a>Holders</a> are warned that
the information in a <a>verifiable credential</a> is sensitive in nature and
highly individualized, making it a high value target for data mining. Services
that advertise free storage of <a>verifiable credentials</a> might in fact be
mining personal data and selling it to organizations wanting to build
individualized profiles on people and organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
<a>Holders</a> need to be aware of the terms of service for their
<a>credential</a> repository, specifically the correlation and data mining
protections in place for those who store their <a>verifiable credentials</a>
with the service provider.
      </p>
      <p>
Some effective mitigations for data mining and profiling include using:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
Service providers that do not sell your information to third parties.
        </li>
        <li>
Software that encrypts <a>verifiable credentials</a> such that a service
provider cannot view the contents of the <a>credential</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
Software that stores <a>verifiable credentials</a> locally on a device that you
control and that does not upload or analyze your information beyond your
expectations.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Aggregation of Credentials</h3>

      <p>
Holding two pieces of information about the same <a>subject</a> almost always
reveals more about the <a>subject</a> than just the sum of the two pieces, even
when the information is delivered through different channels. The aggregation of
<a>verifiable credentials</a> is a privacy risk and all participants in
the ecosystem need to be aware of the risks of data aggregation.
      </p>

      <p>
For example, if two <a>bearer credentials</a>, one for an email address and then
one stating the holder is over the age of 21, are provided across multiple
sessions, the <a>verifier</a> of the information now has a unique identifier
as well as age-related information for that individual. It is now easy to create
and build a profile for the <a>holder</a> such that more and more information is
leaked over time. Aggregation of <a>credentials</a> can also be performed across
multiple sites in collusion with each other, leading to privacy violations.
      </p>

      <p>
From a technological perspective, preventing aggregation of information is a
very difficult privacy problem to address. While new cryptographic techniques,
such as zero-knowledge proofs, are being proposed as solutions to the problem
of aggregation and correlation, the existence of long-lived identifiers and
browser tracking techniques defeats even the most modern cryptographic
techniques.
      </p>

      <p>
The solution to the privacy implications of correlation or aggregation tends not
to be technological in nature, but policy driven instead. Therefore, if a
<a>holder</a> does not want information about them to be aggregated, they must
express this in the <a>verifiable presentations</a> they transmit.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Usage Patterns</h3>

      <p>
Despite the best efforts to assure privacy, actually using
<a>verifiable credentials</a> can potentially lead to de-anonymization and a
loss of privacy. This correlation can occur when:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
The same <a>verifiable credential</a> is presented to the same <a>verifier</a>
more than once. The <a>verifier</a> could infer that the <a>holder</a> is the
same individual.
        </li>
        <li>
The same <a>verifiable credential</a> is presented to different
<a>verifiers</a>, and either those <a>verifiers</a> collude, or a third party
has access to transaction records from both <a>verifiers</a>. An observant
party could infer that the individual presenting the
<a>verifiable credential</a> is the same person at both services. That is, the
accounts are controlled by the same person.
        </li>
        <li>
A <a>subject</a> identifier of a <a>credential</a> refers to the same
<a>subject</a> across multiple <a>presentations</a> or <a>verifiers</a>. Even
when different <a>credentials</a> are presented, if the <a>subject</a>
identifier is the same, <a>verifiers</a> (and those with access to
<a>verifier</a> logs) could infer that the <a>holder</a> of the
<a>credential</a> is the same person.
        </li>
        <li>
The underlying information in a <a>credential</a> can be used to identify an
individual across services. In this case, using information from other sources
(including information provided directly by the <a>holder</a>), <a>verifiers</a>
can use information inside the <a>credential</a> to correlate the individual
with an existing profile. For example, if a <a>holder</a> presents
<a>credentials</a> that include postal code, age, and gender, a <a>verifier</a>
can potentially correlate the <a>subject</a> of that <a>credential</a> with an
established profile. For more information, see [[DEMOGRAPHICS]].
        </li>
        <li>
Passing the identifier of a <a>credential</a> to a centralized revocation
server. The centralized server can correlate the <a>credential</a> usage across
interactions. For example, if a <a>credential</a> is used for proof of age in
this manner, the centralized service could know everywhere that
<a>credential</a> was presented: all liquor stores, bars, adult stores, lottery
purchases, and so on.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
In part, it is possible to mitigate this de-anonymization and loss of privacy
by:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
Using a globally-unique identifier as the <a>subject</a> for any given
<a>credential</a> and never re-use that <a>credential</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
If the <a>credential</a> supports revocation, using a globally-distributed
service for revocation.
        </li>
        <li>
Designing revocation APIs that do not depend on submitting the ID of the
<a>credential</a>. For example, use a revocation list instead of a query.
        </li>
        <li>
Avoiding the association of personally identifiable information with any
specific long-lived <a>subject</a> identifier.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
It is understood that these mitigation techniques are not always practical
or even compatible with necessary usage. Sometimes correlation is a
requirement.
      </p>
      <p>
For example, in some prescription drug monitoring programs, usage monitoring is
a requirement. Enforcement entities need to be able to confirm that individuals
are not cheating the system to get multiple prescriptions for controlled
substances. This statutory or regulatory need to correlate usage overrides
individual privacy concerns.
      </p>

      <p>
<a>Verifiable credentials</a> will also be used to intentionally correlate
individuals across services, for example, when using a common persona to log in
to multiple services, so all activity on each of those services is
intentionally linked to the same individual. This is not a privacy issue as
long as each of those services uses the correlation in the expected manner.
      </p>

      <p>
Privacy risks of <a>credential</a> usage occur when unintended or unexpected
correlation arises from the presentation of <a>credentials</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Sharing Information with the Wrong Party</h3>

      <p>
When a <a>holder</a> chooses to share information with a <a>verifier</a>, it
might be the case that the <a>verifier</a> is acting in bad faith and requests
information that could be used to harm the <a>holder</a>. For example, a
<a>verifier</a> might ask for a bank account number, which could then be used
with other information to defraud the <a>holder</a> or the bank.
      </p>

      <p>
<a>Issuers</a> should strive to tokenize as much information as possible such
that if a <a>holder</a> accidentally transmits <a>credentials</a> to the wrong
<a>verifier</a>, the situation is not catastrophic.
      </p>

      <p>
For example, instead of including a bank account number for the purpose of
checking an individual's bank balance, provide a token that enables the
<a>verifier</a> to check if the balance is above a certain amount. In this
case, the bank could issue a <a>verifiable credential</a> containing a balance
checking token to a <a>holder</a>. The <a>holder</a> would then include the
<a>verifiable credential</a> in a <a>verifiable presentation</a> and bind the
token to a credit checking agency using a digital signature. The
<a>verifier</a> could then wrap the <a>verifiable presentation</a> in their
digital signature, and hand it back to the issuer to dynamically check the
account balance.
      </p>

      <p>
Using this approach, even if a <a>holder</a> shares the account balance token
with the wrong party, an attacker cannot discover the bank account number, nor
the exact value in the account. And given the validity period for the
counter-signature, does not gain access to the token for more than a few
minutes.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Frequency of Claim Issuance</h3>

      <p>
As detailed in Section <a href="#usage-patterns"></a>, usage patterns can be
correlated into certain types of behavior. Part of this correlation is
mitigated when a <a>holder</a> uses a <a>verifiable credential</a> without the
knowledge of the <a>issuer</a>. <a>Issuers</a> can defeat this protection
however, by making their <a>verifiable credentials</a> short lived and renewal
automatic.
      </p>

      <p>
For example, an <code>ageOver</code> <a>verifiable credential</a> is useful for
gaining access to a bar. If an <a>issuer</a> issues such a
<a>verifiable credential</a> with a very short expiration date and an automatic
renewal mechanism, then the <a>issuer</a> could possibly correlate the behavior
of the <a>holder</a> in a way that negatively impacts the <a>holder</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
Organizations providing software to <a>holders</a> should warn them if they
repeatedly use <a>credentials</a> with short lifespans, which could result in
behavior correlation. <a>Issuers</a> should avoid issuing <a>credentials</a> in
a way that enables them to correlate usage patterns.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Prefer Single-Use Credentials</h3>

      <p>
An ideal privacy-respecting system would require only the information necessary
for interaction with the <a>verifier</a> to be disclosed by the <a>holder</a>.
The <a>verifier</a> would then record that the disclosure requirement was met
and forget any sensitive information that was disclosed. In many cases,
competing priorities, such as regulatory burden, prevent this ideal system from
being employed. In other cases, long-lived identifiers prevent single use. The
design of any <a>verifiable credentials</a> ecosystem, however, should strive
to be as privacy-respecting as possible by preferring single-use
<a>verifiable credentials</a> whenever possible.
      </p>

      <p>
Using single-use <a>verifiable credentials</a> provides several benefits. The
first benefit is to <a>verifiers</a> who can be sure that the data in a
<a>verifiable credential</a> is fresh. The second benefit is to <a>holders</a>,
who know that if there are no long-lived identifiers in the
<a>verifiable credential</a>, the <a>verifiable credential</a> itself cannot be
used to track or correlate them online. Finally, there is nothing for attackers
to steal, making the entire ecosystem safer to operate within.

      <h3>Private Browsing</h3>

      <p>
In an ideal private browsing scenario, no personally identifiable information
will be revealed. Because many <a>credentials</a> include personally
identifiable information, organizations providing software to <a>holders</a>
should warn them about the possibility of revealing this information if they
wish to use <a>credentials</a> and <a>presentations</a>
while in private browsing mode. As each browser vendor handles private browsing
differently, and some browsers might not have this feature at all, it is
important for implementers to be aware of these differences and implement
solutions accordingly.

    <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

    <p>
There are a number of security considerations that <a>issuers</a>,
<a>holders</a>, and <a>verifiers</a> should be aware of when processing
data described by this specification. Ignoring or not understanding the
implications of this section can result in security vulnerabilities.
    </p>

    <p>
While this section attempts to highlight a broad set of security
considerations, it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged to seek the
advice of security and cryptography professionals when implementing mission
critical systems using the technology outlined in this specification.
    </p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Cryptography Suites and Libraries</h3>

      <p>
Some aspects of the data model described in this specification can be
protected through the use of cryptography. It is important for implementers
to understand the cryptography suites and libraries used to create and process
<a>credentials</a> and <a>presentations</a>. Implementing and auditing
cryptography systems generally requires substantial experience. Effective
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team">red teaming</a> can also
help remove bias from security reviews.
      </p>

      <p>
Cryptography suites and libraries have a shelf life and eventually fall to
new attacks and technology advances. Production quality systems need to take
this into account and ensure mechanisms exist to easily and proactively upgrade
expired or broken cryptography suites and libraries, and to invalidate
and replace existing <a>credentials</a>. Regular monitoring is important to
ensure the long term viability of systems processing <a>credentials</a>.

      <h3>Content Integrity Protection</h3>

      <p>
<a>Verifiable credentials</a> often contain URLs to data that resides
outside of the <a>verifiable credential</a> itself. Content that exists outside
a <a>verifiable credential</a>, such as links to images, JSON-LD Contexts, and
other machine-readable data, are often not protected against tampering because
the data resides outside of the protection of the
<a href="#proofs-signatures">proof</a> on the <a>verifiable credential</a>.
For example, the following highlighted links are not content-integrity
protected and probably should be:
      </p>

      <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Non-content-integrity protected links">
{
  "@context": [

      </pre>

      <p>
While this specification does not recommend any specific content integrity
protection, document authors who want to ensure links to content are integrity
protected are advised to use URL schemes that enforce content integrity. Two
such schemes are the [[HASHLINK]] specification and the [[IPFS]]. The example
below transforms the previous example and adds content integrity protection to
the JSON-LD Contexts using the [[HASHLINK]] specification, and content integrity
protection to the image by using an [[IPFS]] link.

It is debatable whether the JSON-LD Contexts above need protection as it

While the example above is one way to achieve content integrity protection,
there are other solutions that might be better suited for certain applications.

      <h3>Unsigned Claims</h3>

      <p>
This specification allows <a>credentials</a> to be produced that do not contain
signatures or proofs of any kind. These types of <a>credentials</a> are often
useful for intermediate storage, or self-asserted information, which is
analogous to filling out a form on a web page. Implementers should be aware that
these types of <a>credentials</a> are not <a>verifiable</a> because the
authorship is either not known or cannot be trusted.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Token Binding</h3>

      <p>
A <a>verifier</a> might need to ensure it is the intended recipient of a
<a>verifiable presentation</a> and not the target of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">man-in-the-middle attack</a>.
Approaches such as token binding [[RFC8471]], which ties the request for a
<a>verifiable presentation</a> to the response, can secure the protocol.
Any unsecured protocol is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Bundling Dependent Claims</h3>

      <p>
It is considered best practice for <a>issuers</a> to atomize information in a
<a>credential</a>, or use a signature scheme that allows for selective
disclosure. In the case of atomization, if it is not done securely by the
<a>issuer</a>, the <a>holder</a> might bundle together different
<a>credentials</a> in a way that was not intended by the <a>issuer</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
For example a university might issue two <a>verifiable credentials</a> to a
person, each containing two <a>properties</a>, for example, "Staff Member" in
the "Department of Computing", and "Post Graduate Student" in the "Department of
Economics". If these <a>verifiable credentials</a> are atomized into separate
properties, then the university would issue four credentials to the person, each
containing one of the following properties, "Staff Member", "Post Graduate
Student", "Department of Computing", and "Department of Economics". The
<a>holder</a> could then transfer the "Staff Member" and "Department of
Economics" <a>verifiable credentials</a> to a <a>verifier</a>, which together
would comprise a false claim.

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Highly Dynamic Information</h3>

      <p>
When <a>verifiable credentials</a> are issued for highly dynamic information,
implementers should ensure the expiration times are set appropriately.
Expiration periods longer than the timeframe where the
<a>verifiable credential</a> is valid might create exploitable security
vulnerabilities. Expiration periods shorter than the timeframe where the
information expressed by the <a>verifiable credential</a> is valid creates a
burden on <a>holders</a> and <a>verifiers</a>. It is therefore important to set
validity periods for <a>verifiable credentials</a> that are appropriate to the
use case and the expected lifetime for the information contained in the
<a>verifiable credential</a>.

      <h3>Device Theft and Impersonation</h3>

      <p>
When <a>verifiable credentials</a> are stored on a device and that
device is lost or stolen, it might be possible for an attacker to gain access
to systems using the victim's <a>verifiable credentials</a>. Ways to mitigate
this type of attack include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
Enabling password, pin, pattern, or biometric screen unlock protection on the
device.
        </li>

Enabling password, biometric, or multi-factor authentication for the
<a>credential</a> <a>repository</a>.

        <li>
Enabling password, biometric, or multi-factor authentication when accessing
cryptographic keys.

        <li>
Using a separate hardware-based signature device.

    <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>

    <p>
There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers should be
aware of when processing data described in this specification. As with any web
standards or protocols implementation, ignoring accessibility issues makes
this information unusable to a large subset of the population. It is important
to follow accessibility guidelines and standards, such as [[WCAG21]], to ensure
all people, regardless of ability, can make use of this data. This is
especially important when establishing systems utilizing cryptography, which
historically, have created problems for assistive technologies.
    </p>

    <p>
This section details the general accessibility considerations to take into
account when utilizing this data model.
    </p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Data First Approaches</h3>

      <p>
Many physical <a>credentials</a> in use today, such as government identification
cards, have poor accessibility characteristics, including, but not limited to,
small print, reliance on small and high-resolution images, and no affordances
for people with vision impairments.
      </p>

      <p>
When utilizing this data model to create <a>verifiable credentials</a>, it is
suggested that data model designers use a <em>data first</em> approach. For
example, given the choice of using data or a graphical image to depict a
<a>credential</a>, designers should express every element of the image, such as
the name of an institution or the professional <a>credential</a>, in a
machine-readable way instead of just relying on the image to convey this
information. Using a data first approach is preferred because it provides the
foundational elements of building different interfaces for people with varying
abilities.

    <h2>Internationalization Considerations</h2>

    <p>
There are a number of internationalization considerations implementers should be
aware of when publishing data described in this specification. As with any web
standards or protocols implementation, ignoring internationalization makes it
difficult for data to be produced and consumed across a disparate set of
languages and societies, which would limit the applicability of the
specification and significantly diminish its value as a standard.
    </p>

    <p>
This section outlines general internationalization considerations to take into
account when utilizing this data model.
    </p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Language Declarations</h3>

      <p>
When expressing human-readable text content in the data model, it is important
for presentation, accessibility, and further processing to specify the language
of the text, as follows:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
[[!JSON-LD]] supports the expression of language information using the
<code>@language</code> feature, as described in [[!JSON-LD]] 1.1,
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#string-internationalization">Section 4.2.3: String Internationalization</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
[[!JSON-LD]] also supports the expression of language information using the
<code>rdf:HTML</code> string literal type, as described in [[!JSON-LD]] 1.0,
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#typed-values">Section 4.2.1: Typed Values</a>.
This mechanism enables developers to use the internationalization features
present in HTML to express language information. For example, consider the
following key-value pair:

          <pre>
"nameHtml": "&lt;span lang="jp">和美&lt;/span>"
          </pre>

          <p>
If the JSON-LD Context expressed that any value associated with the
<code>nameHtml</code> property as being of type <code>rdf:HTML</code>, then
software agents rendering the property can deterministically identify the
language in use.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Text direction</h3>

      <p>
When expressing human-readable text content in the data model, it is important
to be able to explicitly encode the text direction. JSON and its derived formats
use the UTF-8 encoding of [[Unicode]] for serializing and transmitting text.
This enables text direction to be directly determined in simple cases,
but the mechanism is insufficient for general use.
      </p>

      <p>
[[!JSON-LD]] supports the expression of text layout information using the
<code>rdf:HTML</code> string literal type, as described in [[!JSON-LD]] 1.0,
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#typed-values">Section 4.2.1: Typed Values</a>.
This mechanism enables developers to use the internationalization features
present in HTML to express language information. For example, consider the
following key-value pair:

      <pre>
"nameHtml": "&lt;span dir="rtl" lang="ar">HTML و CSS: تصميم و إنشاء مواقع الويب&lt;/span>"
      </pre>

      <p>
If the JSON-LD Context states that any value associated with the
<code>nameHtml</code> property is of type <code>rdf:HTML</code>, then software
agents have sufficient information to deterministically identify the text
direction of the language.
      </p>

      <h3>Ruby Text</h3>
      <p>
In some situations it is common to use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_character">Ruby characters</a>
to ensure text information is clear and as useful as possible.
[[!JSON-LD]] support for HTML data allows text to be encoded with ruby,
supporting these cases.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Further Information</h3>
      <p>
The W3C Internationalisation document [[string-meta]] gives more information
about the need to be able to provide reliable metadata about text to support
internationalization.

      <h2>Validation</h2>

      <p>
While this specification does not provide conformance criteria for
the process of the <a>validation</a> of <a>verifiable credentials</a> or
<a>verifiable presentations</a>, readers may be curious about
how the information in this data model is expected to be utilized by
<a>verifiers</a> during the process of <a>validation</a>. This section
captures a selection of conversations held by the Working Group related to the
expected usage of the data fields in this specification by <a>verifiers</a>.
      </p>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Credential Subject</h3>

        <p>
In the <a>verifiable credentials</a> presented by a <a>holder</a>, the
value associated with the <code>id</code> <a>property</a> for each
<code>credentialSubject</code> is expected to identify a <a>subject</a> to the
<a>verifier</a>. If the <a>holder</a> is also the <a>subject</a>, then
the <a>verifier</a> could authenticate the <a>holder</a> if they have
public key metadata related to the <a>holder</a>. The <a>verifier</a> could then
authenticate the <a>holder</a> using a signature generated by the <a>holder</a>
contained in the <a>verifiable presentation</a>. The <code>id</code>
<a>property</a> is optional. <a>Verifiers</a> could use other
<a>properties</a> in a <a>verifiable credential</a> to uniquely identify a
<a>subject</a>.

        <p class="note">
For information on how authentication and WebAuthn might work with
<a>verifiable credentials</a>, please refer to the

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Issuer</h3>

        <p>
The value associated with the <code>issuer</code> <a>property</a> is expected
to identify an <a>issuer</a> that is known to and trusted by the
<a>verifier</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
Relevant metadata about the <code>issuer</code> <a>property</a> is expected
to be available to the <a>verifier</a>. For example, an <a>issuer</a> can
publish information containing the public keys it uses to digitally sign
<a>verifiable credentials</a> that it issued. This metadata is relevant
when checking the proofs on the <a>verifiable credentials</a>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Issuance Date</h3>

        <p>
The <code>issuanceDate</code> is expected to be within an expected range for
the <a>verifier</a>. For example, a <a>verifier</a> can ensure that the
issuance date of a <a>verifiable credential</a> is not in the future.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Proofs (Signatures)</h3>

        <p>
The cryptographic mechanism used to prove that the information in a
<a>verifiable credential</a> or a <a>verifiable presentation</a> has not been
tampered with is called a <em>proof</em>. There are many types of
cryptographic proofs including, but not limited to, digital signatures,
zero-knowledge proofs, Proofs of Work, and Proofs of Stake. In general, when
verifying proofs implementations are expected to ensure that:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
The proof is available in the form of a known proof suite.
          </li>
          <li>
All required proof suite <a>properties</a> are present.
          </li>
          <li>
The proof suite <a>verification</a> algorithm, when applied to the data,
results in an acceptable proof.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
Some proofs are digital signatures. In general, when verifying digital
signatures, implementations are expected to ensure that:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
Acceptably recent metadata regarding the public key associated with the
signature is available. For example, the metadata might include
<a>properties</a> related to expiration, key owner, or key purpose.
          </li>
          <li>
The key is not suspended, revoked, or expired.
          </li>
          <li>
The cryptographic signature is expected to verify.
          </li>
          <li>
If the cryptographic suite expects a <code>proofPurpose</code> <a>property</a>,
it is expected to exist and be a valid value, such as
<code>credentialIssuance</code>).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="note">
The digital signature provides a number of protections, other than tamper
resistance, that are not immediately obvious. For example, a Linked Data
Signature <code>created</code> <a>property</a> establishes a date and time
before which the <a>credential</a> should not be considered <a>verified</a>. The
<code>creator</code> <a>property</a> enables the ability to dynamically
discover information about the <a>entity</a> who created the data to ensure
that the public key is not revoked or expired. The <code>proofPurpose</code>
<a>property</a> ensures the reason the entity created the signature, such as
for authentication or creating a <a>verifiable credential</a>, is clear and
protected in the signature.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Expiration</h3>

        <p>
The <code>expirationDate</code> is expected to be within an expected range
for the <a>verifier</a>. For example, a <a>verifier</a> can ensure that the
expiration date of a <a>verifiable credential</a> is not in the past.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Status</h3>

        <p>
If the <code>credentialStatus</code> property is available, the status of a
<a>verifiable credential</a> is expected to be evaluated by the
<a>verifier</a> according to the <code>credentialStatus</code> <a>type</a>
definition for the <a>verifiable credential</a> and the <a>verifier's</a>
own status evaluation criteria. For example, a <a>verifier</a> can ensure that
the status of the <a>verifiable credential</a> was withdrawn for cause
by the <a>issuer</a>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Fitness for Purpose</h3>

        <p>
The custom <a>properties</a> in the <a>verifiable credential</a> are appropriate
for the <a>verifier's</a> purpose. For example if a <a>verifier</a> needs to
determine whether a <a>subject</a> is older than 21 years of age, they might
rely on a specific <code>birthdate</code> <a>property</a>, or more abstract
<a>properties</a>, such as <code>ageOver</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
The <a>issuer</a> is trusted by the <a>verifier</a> to make the <a>claims</a>
at hand. For example, a franchised fast food restaurant location trusts
discount coupon <a>claims</a> made by the corporate headquarters of the
franchise. Policy information expressed by the <a>issuer</a> in the
<a>verifiable credential</a> should be respected by <a>holders</a> and
<a>verifiers</a> unless they accept the liability of ignoring the policy.

      <h3>Subject-Holder Relationships</h3>

      <p>
This section describes the possible relationships between a <a>subject</a>

these relationships. The following diagram illustrates the different types of
relationships covered in the rest of this section.

Subject-Holder Relationships in Verifiable Credentials.

      <p>
The following sections describe how each of these relationships are handled in
the data model.
      </p>

      <section class="informative">
        <h4>Subject is the Holder</h4>

        <p>
The most common relationship is when a <a>subject</a> is the <a>holder</a>. In
this case, a <a>verifier</a> can easily deduce that a <a>subject</a> is the
<a>holder</a> if the <a>verifiable presentation</a> is digitally signed by the
<a>holder</a> and all contained <a>verifiable credentials</a> are about a
<a>subject</a> that can be identified to be the same as the <a>holder</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
If only the <code>credentialSubject</code> is allowed to insert a
<a>verifiable credential</a> into a <a>verifiable presentation</a>, the
<a>issuer</a> may insert the <code>nonTransferable</code> <a>property</a> into the
<a>verifiable credential</a>, as described below.
        </p>

        <section class="informative">
          <h5>nonTransferable Property</h5>

          <p>
The <code>nonTransferable</code> <a>property</a> indicates that a
<a>verifiable credential</a> must only be encapsulated into a
<a>verifiable presentation</a> whose proof was issued by the
<code>credentialSubject</code>. A <a>verifiable presentation</a> that contains
a <a>verifiable credential</a> containing the <code>nonTransferable</code>
<a>property</a>, whose proof creator is not the <code>credentialSubject</code>,
is invalid.

        <h4>Credential Uniquely Identifies a Subject</h4>

        <p>
In this case, the <code>credentialSubject</code> <a>property</a> might contain
multiple <a>properties</a>, each providing an aspect of a description of the
<a>subject</a>, which combine together to unambiguously identify the <a>subject</a>.
Some use cases might not require the <a>holder</a> to be identified at all,
such as checking to see if a doctor (the <a>subject</a>) is board-certified.
Other use cases might require the <a>verifier</a> to use out-of-band knowledge
to determine the relationship between the <a>subject</a> and the <a>holder</a>.
        </p>

The example above uniquely identifies the <a>subject</a> using the name,
address, and birthdate of the individual.

      <section class="informative">
        <h4>Subject Passes the Verifiable Credential to a Holder</h4>

        <p>
Usually <a>verifiable credentials</a> are presented to <a>verifiers</a> by the
<a>subject</a>. However in some cases, the <a>subject</a> might need to pass
the whole or part of a <a>verifiable credential</a> to another <a>holder</a>.
For example, if a patient (the <a>subject</a>) is too ill to take a
prescription (the <a>verifiable credential</a>) to the pharmacist (the
<a>verifier</a>), a friend might take the prescription in to pick up the
medication.
        </p>

        <p>
The data model allows for this, by the <a>subject</a> issuing a new
<a>verifiable credential</a> and giving it to the new <a>holder</a>, who can
then present both <a>verifiable credentials</a> to the <a>verifier</a>.
However, the content of this second <a>verifiable credential</a> is likely to
be application specific, so this specification cannot standardize the contents
of this second <a>verifiable credential</a>. Nevertheless, a non-normative
example is provided in Appendix

        <h4>Holder Acts on Behalf of the Subject</h4>

        <p>
The Verifiable Credentials Data Model supports the <a>holder</a> acting on
behalf of the <a>subject</a> in at least the following ways. The:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
<a>Issuer</a> can include the relationship between the <a>holder</a> and
the <a>subject</a> in the <code>credentialSubject</code> <a>property</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Issuer</a> can express the relationship between the <a>holder</a> and
the <a>subject</a> by issuing a new <a>verifiable credential</a>, which the
<a>holder</a> utilizes.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Subject</a> can express their relationship with the <a>holder</a> by
issuing a new <a>verifiable credential</a>, which the <a>holder</a> utilizes.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
The mechanisms listed above describe the relationship between the
<a>holder</a> and the <a>subject</a> and helps the <a>verifier</a> decide
whether the relationship is sufficiently expressed for a given use case.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
The additional mechanisms the <a>issuer</a> or the <a>verifier</a> uses to
verify the relationship between the <a>subject</a> and the <a>holder</a> are
outside the scope of this specification.

      <h3>Subject Passes a Verifiable Credential to Someone Else</h3>

      <p>
When a <a>subject</a> passes a <a>verifiable credential</a> to another
<a>holder</a>, the <a>subject</a> might issue a new
<a>verifiable credential</a> to the <a>holder</a> in which the:

      <ul>
        <li>
<a>Issuer</a> is the <a>subject</a>

<a>Subject</a> is the <a>holder</a> to whom the <a>verifiable credential</a> is

        <li>
<a>Claim</a> contains the <a>properties</a> being passed on.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
The <a>holder</a> can now create a <a>verifiable presentation</a> containing
these two <a>verifiable credentials</a> so that the <a>verifier</a> can
<a>verify</a> that the <a>subject</a> gave the original
<a>verifiable credential</a> to the <a>holder</a>.

In the above example, a patient (the original <a>subject</a>) passed a
prescription (the original <a>verifiable credential</a>) to a friend, and
issued a new <a>verifiable credential</a> to the friend, in which the friend is
the <a>subject</a>, the original <a>subject</a> is the <a>issuer</a>, and the
<a>credential</a> is a copy of the original prescription.

When an <a>issuer</a> wants to authorize a <a>holder</a> to possess a

Verifiable credentials are not an authorization framework and therefore
delegation is out of scope for this specification. However, it is understood

delegation systems. The following is one approach that may be appropriate for
some use cases.

The Verifiable Credentials Data Model currently does not support either of
these scenarios. It is for further study how they might be supported.
