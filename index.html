      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

      <p>
Credentials are a part of our daily lives; driver's licenses are used to
assert that we are capable of operating a motor vehicle, university degrees
can be used to assert our level of education, and government-issued passports
enable us to travel between countries. These credentials provide benefits
to us when used in the physical world, but their use on the Web continues to
be elusive.
      </p>

      <p>
It is currently difficult to express banking account information,
education qualifications, healthcare data, and other sorts of machine-readable
personal information that has been verified by a 3rd party on the Web and this
makes it difficult to receive the same benefits from the Web that physical
credentials provide us in the physical world.
      </p>

      <p>
This specification provides a
standard way to express credentials on the Web in a way that is
cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable.
      </p>
      <p>
For those that are unfamiliar with the concepts related to verifiable credentials,
the following sections provide an overview of:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
what a verifiable credential is and how it's comprised,
        </li>
        <li>
what a presentation presentation (derived from verifiable credential) is and how it's comprised,
        </li>
        <li>
an ecosystem where verifiable credentials and presentations are expected to be useful, and
        </li>
        <li>
the use cases and requirements that informed this specification
        </li>
      </ol>
      </p>

<section>
      <h3> Overview</h3>
    <section>
      <h3>What is a Verifiable Credential?</h3>

      <p>
In the physical world, a credential may consist of:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
information related to the subject of the credential (e.g. photo, name, and
identification number),
        </li>
        <li>
information related to the issuing authority (e.g. city government,
national agency, or certification body),
        </li>
        <li>
evidence related to how the credential was derived, and
        </li>
        <li>
information related to expiration dates.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
A verifiable credential is capable of representing all of the same information
that a physical credential is intended to represent. The addition of
digital technologies, such as digital signatures, also make verifiable
credentials more tamperproof and therefore more trustworthy
than their physical counterparts. Verifiable credentials can also be
presented over the Internet, making them more convenient than
their physical counterparts when needing to establish trust at a distance.
      </p>

    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>What is a Presentation?</h3>
      <p>
Holders can generate presentations and share them with a verifier to prove
they possess verifiable credentials with certain characteristics. Exchanging
presentations over long distances is also possible through the Internet, making them
more convenient when needing to establish trust over long distances.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h3>Ecosystem Overview</h3>

      <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

      <p>
This section outlines a basic set of roles and an ecosystem where verifiable
credentials are expected to be useful. In this section, we distinguish the essential
roles of core actors and the relationships between them; how do they interact?
A role is an abstraction that might be implemented in many different ways. The
separation of roles suggests likely interfaces and/or protocols for
standardization. The following roles are introduced in this specification:
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><a>holder</a></dt>
        <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> may perform by possessing one or more
<a>verifiable credentials</a> and generating <a>presentations</a> from them. Examples of holders include students,
employees, and customers.
        </dd>
        <dt><a>issuer</a></dt>
        <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> may perform by creating a <a>verifiable credential</a>,
associating it with a particular <a>subject</a>, and transmitting it to
a <a>holder</a>. Examples of issuers include corporations, non-profits,
trade associations, governments, and individuals.
        </dd>
        <dt><a>verifier</a></dt>
        <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> may perform by requesting and receiving a
<a>verifiable presentation</a> that proves the holder possesses the required verifiable credentials with certain characteristics.
Examples of verifiers include employers, security personnel, and websites.
        </dd>
        <dt><a>Verifiable data repository</a></dt>
        <dd>
Mediates the creation and verification of <a>issuer</a> identifiers, keys and
other relevant data required to use verifiable credentials. Examples of
such data repositories include trusted databases, decentralised databases,
government ID databases, and distributed ledgers.
        </dd>
      </dl>

        <img style="margin: auto; display: block;" width="75%" src="diagrams/ecosystem.svg">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
The roles and information flows that form the basis for this specification.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p class="note">
The ecosystem above is provided as an example to the reader in order to ground
the rest of the concepts in this specification. Other ecosystems exist, such as
protected environments or proprietary systems, where verifiable credentials also
provide benefit.
      </p>

      <p class="issue" data-title="Incomplete list of roles and terminology">
The VCWG is actively discussing the number of roles and terminology used
in this specification.
The group expects terminology and role identification to be an ongoing
discussion and will be influenced by
public feedback on the specification. At present, the following incomplete
list of roles and terminology have been considered: Subject, Issuer, Authority,
Author, Signatory, Holder, Presenter, Asserter, Claimant, Sharer,
Subject's Agent, Prover, Mediator, Inspector, Evaluator, Verifier, Consumer, and
Relying Party. Some of these are aliases for the same concept, others are
possibly new roles in the ecosystem. Reviewers should be aware that the
terminology used in this document is not necessarily final and the group is
actively soliciting feedback on the roles and terminology used in this
specification.

      <h3>Use Cases and Requirements</h3>

      <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

      <p>
The Verifiable Credentials Use Cases[[VC-USECASES]] document outlines a number of
key topics that readers may find useful, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
a more thorough explanation of the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-use-cases/#user-roles">roles</a>
introduced above,
        </li>
        <li>
the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-use-cases/#user-needs">needs</a>
identified in market verticals like education, finance, healthcare, retail,
professional licensing, and government,
        </li>
        <li>
common
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-use-cases/#user-tasks">tasks</a>
performed by the roles in the ecosystem, as well as their associated
requirements, and
        </li>
        <li>
common
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-use-cases/#user-sequences">sequences and flows</a>
identified by the Working Group.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
As a result of documenting and analyzing the use cases document, a number of
desirable ecosystem characteristics have been identified for this
specification, namely:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
<a>Holders</a> receive and store <a>verifiable credentials</a> from
<a>issuers</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>Holders</a> may use an agent that the issuer does not need to trust.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>Holders</a> are positioned between <a>issuers</a> and <a>verifiers</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>Holders</a> generate <a>verifiable presentations</a> from their <a>verifiable credentials</a> as
needed and provide these <a>verifiable presentations</a> to <a>verifiers</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>Holders</a> may use an agent that verifiers needn't trust; they only need to trust
<a>issuers</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>Verifiable credentials</a> are associated with <a>subjects</a>, not
particular services; <a>holders</a> decide how to aggregate and manage
<a>verifiable credentials</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>Holders</a> are able to easily control and own their own identifiers.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>Holders</a> control which <a>verifiable credentials</a> to use and when.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>Holders</a> are be able to freely choose and change the agents they employ
to help them manage their <a>verifiable credentials</a> and generate and share <a>verifiable presentations</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>Holders</a> that share <a>verifiable presentations</a> never need to
reveal the identity of the <a>verifier</a> to <a>issuers</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>Holders</a> in <a>presentations</a> can either disclose the attributes or satisfy <a>predicates</a>
requested by the <a>verifier</a>. <a>Predicates</a> are boolean conditions like greater/less than or
equal to, is in set, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>Verifiable credentials</a> and <a>verifiable presentations</a> are expressed in one or more standard,
machine-readable data formats which can also be extended with minimal
coordination.
        </li>
        <li>
Issuers independently issue <a>verifiable credentials</a>, and holders store them. When requested, Holders generate <a>verifiable presentations</a>, and verifiers independently verify them.
        </li>
        <li>
<a>Verifiable Credentials</a> can be revoked by the <a>issuer</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="issue">
There are
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-use-cases/#user-tasks">other requirements</a>
listed in the Verifiable Credentials Use Cases
document that may or may not be aligned with the requirements listed above.
The VCWG will be ensuring alignment of the list of requirements from both
documents over time and will most likely move the list of requirements to a
single document.

      <h2>Core Data Model</h2>

      <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

      <p>
The following sections outline core data model concepts, such as
<a>claims</a>, <a>credentials</a>, and <a>presentations</a>, that form the
foundation of this specification.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Claims</h3>

        <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

        <p>
A <a>claim</a> is statement about a <a>subject</a>.
A <a>subject</a> is an <a>entity</a> about which <a>claims</a> may be made.
<a>Claims</a> are expressed using
<strong><em>subject</em></strong>-<dfn data-lt="property|properties">property</dfn>-<dfn>value</dfn>
relationships.
        </p>

      <figure>
        <img style="margin: auto; display: block;"
          width="50%" src="diagrams/claim.svg">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
The basic structure of a claim.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
The data model for <a>claims</a> described above is powerful and can be used to
express a large variety of statements. For example, a claim specifying the data of birth of a subject
can be used to prove that its age lies in an interval or is greater or less than a some value which is
needed in use cases like proving drinking age or teenager discount or elderly discount;
the holder has the flexibility to use the claim in any way that is applicable to that claim:
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img style="margin: auto; display: block;"
          width="50%" src="diagrams/claim-example.svg">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
An example of a basic claim that expresses that Pat is over the age of 21.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
These claims may be merged together to express a graph of
information about a particular subject. The example below extends the
data model above by adding claims that state that Pat knows Sam and that
Sam is employed as a professor.
      </p>

      <!-- TODO: Update the next picture -->

        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
Multiple claims may be combined to express a more complex graph.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
At this point, the concept of a <a>claim</a> has been introduced. To enable
one to trust the claims, more information must be added to the graph
of information.
      </p>

    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Credentials</h2>

      <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

      <p>
A <a>credential</a> is set of one or more <a>claims</a> made by the
same <a>entity</a>. It may include an identifier to uniquely identify the
credential which helps in revoking the credential, as well as metadata that
describes properties of the credential itself such as: the <a>issuer</a>, 
the public key to use, the revocation mechanism to use etc. This metadata can
either be signed by the issuer or not, more on that later. The credential identifier
is never revealed to the verifier to prevent the issuer and verifier from
colluding to correlate the verifier.
A <a>verifiable credential</a> is a set of claims and meta data that are
tamper-resistant and that cryptographically prove who issued it.
      </p>
       <!-- TODO: Update the next picture to show the keys, schema, etc-->

        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
Examples of verifiable credentials include digital employee identification
cards, digital birth certificates, digital educational certificates, etc.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
It is possible to have a <a>credential</a>, such as a marriage certificate,
that contains multiple <a>claims</a> about different <a>subjects</a> that are
not required to be related.
      </p>

    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Presentations</h2>

      <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

      <p>
As this specification takes a privacy-first approach, it is important that
the entities that use this technology are able to express only the portions of
their persona that are appropriate for the situation. The expression of a
subset of one's persona is called a <a>verifiable presentation</a> (or a derived credential).
      </p>

      <p>
A holder generates a <a>verifiable presentation</a> from a collection of one or more
<a>verifiable credentials</a> that are often about the same <a>subject</a> that
have been issued by multiple <a>issuers</a>. The aggregation of this
information typically expresses an aspect of a person, organization, or entity.
      </p>
        <!-- TODO: Update the next picture-->
      <figure>

        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
The basic components of a verifiable presentation.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
Examples of different presentations include a person's professional persona, online
gaming persona, or home life persona.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
It is possible to generate a <a>presentation</a>, such as in the context of a business persona,
that is derived from multiple <a>credentials</a> about different <a>subjects</a>
that are often, but not required to be, related.
      </p>

    </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>Trust Model</h1>

      <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

      <p>
The Verifiable Credentials trust model is as follows:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
The <a>verifier</a> trusts the <a>issuer</a> to issue the <a>credential</a>
that it receives. In order to establish this trust, a credential MUST
either 1) include a <a href="#proofs-aka-signatures">proof</a> that establishes
that the issuer generated the credential only after sufficient scrutiny (it is a <a>verifiable credential</a>),
or 2) have been transmitted in a way that clearly establishes that the
issuer generated the credential and that the credential has not been tampered
with in transit or storage. This trust could be weakened depending upon the
risk assessment of the verifier.
        </li>
        <li>
All entities trust the <a>identifier registry</a> to be un-corruptible and
to be a correct record of which data is owned (and can be updated) by which
<a>entities</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
The <a>subject</a> trusts (since only the holder can verify) the <a>issuer</a> to issue true (i.e. not false)
<a>credentials</a> about the subject, and to revoke them quickly when
appropriate.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
This trust model differentiates itself from other trust models by ensuring that
the <a>issuer</a> does not need to trust (or even know) the <a>verifier</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
By decoupling the trust between the <a>identity provider</a> and the
<a>relying party</a>, a more flexible and dynamic trust model is created
such that market competition and customer choice is increased.

            <p>
                Apart from the subject specific claims inside a credential, the credential contains
                additional data like the issuer's id, public key to use to verify the credential,
                the schema (structure) of the credential, the issuance date, expiration date, etc.
                Depending on the metadata (and other metadata included), some elements of metadata
                may or may not be signed by the issuer.
            </p>
            <dl>
              <dt><var>Issuer</var></dt>
              <dd>
                  The value of this property MUST be a URI. It is RECOMMENDED that dereferencing
                  the URI results in a document containing machine-readable information about
                  the issuer that may be used to verify the information expressed in the
                  <a>credential</a>.
              </dd>
              <dt><var>Schema</var></dt>
              <dd>
                  A Schema describes the attributes of the credential. It specifies the name,
                  data types and encoding of each attribute. A schema may be embedded or may be
                  referenced on an immutable storage. The schema should be included in the signature
                  to prevent the holder from crafting false proofs.
              </dd>
              <dt><var>Public key</var></dt>
              <dd>
                  The public key is created by the issuer and can be used by anyone to verify the proofs
                  created from the credential. In certain kinds of credentials, it is strongly advised to
                  create a new public key per schema. Public key is not included in the signature since it
                  is a priori to verify the signature.
              </dd>
              <dt><var>Issuance date</var></dt>
              <dd>
                  This date/time represents the earliest date when the information
                  associated with the claim property became valid. The date is specified as the number of seconds since epoch.
                  This needs to included in the signature since it allows the holder to selectively disclose or satisfy predicates on.
              </dd>
              <dt><var>Expiration date</var></dt>
              <dd>
                  This date/time after which the credential will cease to be valid.
                  The date is specified as the number of seconds since epoch. Needs to be
                  included in the signature for the same reasons as issuance date.
              </dd>
            </dl>

            <p>
                Alternatively some of the above data like issuer identifier, schema and public key can be bound together
                in a single object and the credential then refers the single object. This is how it is done is Sovrin and the
                binding object is called credential definition and is called "cred_def_id".
                The issuance date and expiration date can be specified as a part of schema which lets
                them have custom encodings.

        <h2>Claims</h2>

          <p>
            Claims are the assertions issuer makes about the subject. Examples of claims
            include date of birth, yearly income, credit score, weight, height, etc. To create
            <a>verifiable presentations</a> over such claims, it is important to specify how the
            values in these claims are encoded, eg height is in inches or centimeters, income is in
            USD or euros and so on. Notice the different ways of specifying the schema.

        <h2>Signatures</h2>
        <p>
            In order for a credential or presentation to be made verifiable, the "proof" property MUST be present.
            There can be a proof over the metadata too.
            <i>TODO: Add signature section for metadata. Since metadata's signature is RSA, DSA, ECDSA, etc i.e something
                that does not allow selective disclosure, the signature scheme can be different from the one used in signing the claims.</i>
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt><var>proof</var></dt>
          <dd>
            The method used for a mathematical proof will vary by representation language
            and the technology used.  For example, if digital signatures are used for
            the proof mechanism, this property is expected to have a value that is a
            set of name-value pairs including at least a signature, a reference to the
            signing entity, and a representation of the signing date.

        <p>Information about the current status of a <a>verifiable credential</a>,
        such as suspension or revocation,
        may be provided by adding the <code>credentialStatus</code> <a>property</a>.
This property
       comprises the type of credential status information that is being provided
 (sometimes referred to as the credential status scheme), plus the id of the status
type instance. The precise contents of the credential status information is
           determined by the specific <code>credentialStatus</code> type definition,
    and will vary
 depending upon a variety of factors, such as whether it is
            simple to implement or privacy-enhancing.

        <dl>
          <dt><var>credentialStatus</var></dt>
          <dd>The value of this property MUST be a credential status scheme that
            provides enough information to determine the current status of the
            credential (e.g. suspended, revoked, etc.).

        <h2>Presentations</h2>

        <p>
Credentials MAY be composed by placing them into a data structure called a
<a>presentation</a>. A <a>verifiable presentation</a> is a presentation that contains
<a>verifiable credentials</a> and one or more proofs that are appropriate
for the presentation. The basic structure of a <a>verifiable presentation</a>
is provided below:
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Basic structure of a presentation">

  <span class="highlight">"verifiableCredential": [{ ... }],
  "proof": [{ ... }]</span>
}
        </pre>
        <p>
The contents of the <code>verifiableCredential</code> property are
<a>verifiable credentials</a> as described by this specification. The contents
of the <code>proof</code> property are proofs as described by the
Linked Data Proofs [[LD-PROOFS]] specification.
        </p>

          <p>
              As mentioned above in the proofs section, presentation that allow for selective
              disclosure and prevent correlation don't require supplying the complete credentials
              or their proofs during presentation.

      <section>
        <h2>Extensibility</h2>

        <p>
One of the goals of the Verifiable Credentials Data Model is to enable
permissionless innovation. This requires that the data model is extensible
in a number of different ways:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
The requirement to model complex multi-entity relationships is provided
through the use of a graph-based data model.
          </li>
          <li>
The requirement to be able to extend the machine-readable vocabularies
used to describe information in the data model without the use of a
centralized system for doing so is accomplished via the use
of [[LINKED-DATA]].
          </li>
          <li>
The requirement to support multiple types of cryptographic proof formats is
accomplished via the use of Linked Data Proofs [[LD-PROOFS]], 
Linked Data Signatures [[LD-SIGNATURES]], and a variety of signature suites.
          </li>
          <li>
The requirement to provide all of the extensibility mechanisms outlined above
in a data format that is popular among software developers and web page authors
is enabled via the use of [[!JSON-LD]].
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
This approach to data modelling is often called an "open world assumption",
meaning that any entity can say anything about any other entity. This approach
often feels in conflict with building simple and predictable software systems.
Balancing extensibility with program correctness is always more challenging
with an open world assumption than it is with closed software systems.
        </p>

        <p>
The rest of this section describes how both extensibility and program
correctness are achieved through a series of examples.
        </p>

        <p>
Let us assume that we start with the following <a>verifiable credential</a>:
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="A simple credential">
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/credentials/v1",
  "id": "http://example.com/credentials/4643",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential"],
  "issuer": "https://example.com/issuers/14",
  "issued": "2018-02-24T05:28:04Z",
  "claim": {
    "id": "did:example:abcdef1234567",
    "name": "Jane Doe"
  },
  "proof": { ... }
}
        </pre>

        <p>
The credential above simply states that the entity associated with
<code>did:example:abcdef1234567</code> has a <code>name</code> with a
value of <code>Jane Doe</code>. Let's assume that a developer wanted to
extend the <a>verifiable credential</a> to store two additional pieces of
information: an internal corporate reference number, and Jane's favorite
food.
        </p>

        <p>
The first thing that a developer would do is create a JSON-LD Context
containing the two new terms:
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="An example JSON-LD Context">
{
  "@context": {
    "referenceNumber": "https://example.com/vocab#referenceNumber",
    "favoriteFood": "https://example.com/vocab#favoriteFood"
  }
}
        </pre>

        <p>
Now that the JSON-LD Context has been created, the developer must publish it
somewhere that is accessible to <a>verifiers</a> that will be processing the
<a>verifiable credential</a>. For this example, let us assume that the
JSON-LD Context above is published at the following URL:
<code>https://example.com/contexts/mycontext.jsonld</code>. At this point,
extending the first example in this section is a simple matter of including the
context above and adding the new properties to the <a>verifiable credential</a>.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight"
          title="A verifiable credential with a custom extension">
{
  "@context": <span class="highlight">[
    </span>"https://w3id.org/credentials/v1",
    <span class="highlight">"https://example.com/contexts/mycontext.jsonld"
  ]</span>,
  "id": "http://example.com/credentials/4643",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential"],
  "issuer": "https://example.com/issuers/14",
  "issued": "2018-02-24T05:28:04Z",
  <span class="highlight">"referenceNumber": 83294847,</span>
  "claim": {
    "id": "did:example:abcdef1234567",
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    <span class="highlight">"favoriteFood": "Papaya"</span>
  },
  "proof": { ... }
}
        </pre>

        <p>
The examples so far have shown that it is easy to extend the Verifiable
Credentials Data Model in a permissionless and decentralized way. The
mechanism shown also ensures that verifiable credentials that were created
in this way provide a mechanism to prevent namespace conflicts and
semantic ambiguity.
        </p>

        <p>
An extensibility model that is this dynamic does increase implementation burden.
Software written for such a system will have to determine if accepting
<a>verifiable credentials</a> with extensions is acceptable based on the
risk profile of the application. Some applications may choose to only accept
certain extensions while highly secure environments may require that no
extensions are allowed. These decisions are up to the developers of these
applications and are specifically not the domain of this specification.
Applications that do not understand the semantic meaning of all properties
while processing a verifiable credential or a verifiable presentation MUST
produce an error.
        </p>

        <p>
Implementations MUST produce an error when an extension JSON-LD Context
overrides the expanded URL for a term specified in the base JSON-LD Context
(<code>https://w3id.org/credentials/v1</code>). To avoid the possibility of
accidentally overriding terms, developers are urged to scope their extensions.
For example, the following extension scopes the new <code>favoriteFood</code>
term so that it may only be used within the <code>claim</code> property:
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Scoping terms in a JSON-LD Context">
{
  "@context": {
    "referenceNumber": "https://example.com/vocab#referenceNumber",
    <span class="highlight">"claim": {
      "@id": "https://w3id.org/credentials#claim",
      "@context": {
        "favoriteFood": "https://example.com/vocab#favoriteFood"
      }
    }</span>
  }
}
        </pre>

        <p>
Developers are urged to ensure that extension JSON-LD Contexts are highly
available. Implementations that cannot fetch a context will produce an error.
Strategies for ensuring that extension JSON-LD Contexts are always available
include using content-addressed URLs for contexts, bundling context documents
with implementations, or enabling aggressive caching of contexts.

        <h2>Evidence</h2>

        <p>
The <em>evidence</em> property is used by an <a>issuer</a> to represent the
set of evidence that was used to determine whether or not to issue
a <a>credential</a>. For example, an issuer might check physical documentation
provided by the <a>subject</a> or might perform a set of background checks
before issuing the credential. In certain scenarios, this information is useful
to the <a>verifier</a> when determining the risk associated with accepting
the credential.
        </p>

        <p>
Evidence information for the credential in the Verifiable Credentials Data
Model is provided by adding the following <a>property</a>:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><var>evidence</var></dt>
          <dd>The value of this property MUST be one or more evidence schemes
            that provides enough information to a <a>verifier</a>
            to determine whether or not the evidence gathered meets their

            by the particular scheme itself.

The time may come when an <a>entity</a> wants dispute a <a>credential</a>
issued by another entity. The mechanism for doing this is the same as issuing
a regular credential except that the <a>subject</a> identifier for the
<a>claims</a> are those of the disputed credential. For example, if a disputed
credential with an identifier of <code>https://example.org/credentials/245</code>
contains disputed statements, an entity would issue the following credential
in a public venue to make it known that the credential is disputed:
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Expressing a disputed credential">

      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Credential</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Required properties MUST be present. For example, for a

          and <code>proof</code> properties are required.</li>
          <li>Property values MUST match expectations described in this
          specification. For example, the document <code>type</code> property
          for a verifiable credential MUST contain the class
          <code>VerifiableCredential</code>.</li>

        <h3>Issuer</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The value associated with the <code>issuer</code>
          property MUST identify an <a>issuer</a> that is known to and trusted
          by the <a>verifier</a>.</li>
          <li>Pertinent metadata about the <code>issuer</code> MUST be
          available to the <a>verifier</a>. For example, an issuer may publish
          information that contains the public keys they use to digitally
          sign <a>verifiable credentials</a> that they have issued. This
          metadata is pertinent when checking the proofs on the
          <a>verifiable credential</a>.</li>

      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Subject</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The value associated with the <code>id</code> property for each
          <a>claim</a> MUST identify a <a>subject</a> to the
          <a>verifier</a>. For example, if a subject is identified and the
          verifier has public key metadata related to the subject that is
          used for authentication purposes, then the verifier MAY be able to
          authenticate the subject via a signature generated by the subject
          that is contained in the <a>verifiable presentation</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">
The <code>id</code> property is optional, and <a>verifiers</a> MAY use other
properties in a claim to uniquely identify the <a>subject</a>.

      <section>
        <h3>Signatures / Proofs</h3>

        <p>
The cryptographic mechanism used to prove that the information in a
<a>verifiable credential</a> or a <a>verifiable presentation</a> has not been
tampered with is called a <em>proof</em>. There are many types of cryptographic proofs
including but not limited to, digital signatures, zero knowledge proofs,
proofs of work, and proofs of stake. In general, when verifying proofs,
implementations MUST ensure that:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>The proof is available in the form of a known proof suite.</li>
          <li>All required proof suite properties are present.</li>
          <li>The proof suite verification agorithm, when applied to the
          data, results in an acceptable proof.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
Some proofs are digital signatures. In general, when verifying digital
signatures, implementations MUST ensure that:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Acceptably recent metadata regarding the public key
          associated with the signature is available. For example, the
          metadata may include properties related to expiration, key owner,
          or key purpose.</li>
          <li>The key MUST NOT be revoked or expired.</li>
          <li>The cryptographic signature MUST be valid.</li>
          <li>If a <code>proofPurpose</code> exists, it MUST be a valid value
          per the cryptographic suite.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="note">
The digital signature provides a number of protections, other than tamper
resistance, that are not immediately obvious.
For example, a Linked Data Signature's <code>created</code> property
establishes a date and time where the credential SHOULD NOT be considered
valid before that date and time. The  <code>creator</code> property enables
the ability to dynamically discover information about the entity that created
the data to ensure that the public key has not been revoked or expired.
The <code>proofPurpose</code> property ensures that the reason the entity
created the signature, such as for the purposes of authentication or creating
a verifiable credential, are clear and protected in the signature.

        <h3>Issued</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>The <code>issued</code> date MUST be in an expected range for
          the <a>verifier</a>. For example, a verifier may ensure that the
          issued date of a <a>verifiable credential</a> is not in the
          future.</li>

      <section>
        <h3>Revocation</h3>

          have been revoked.</p>
            <p>
                As mentioned above the issuer uses the credential identifier
                to revoke the credential, if the holder provided the credential identifier
                to the verifier to prove non-revocation, the issuer and verifier can collude to
                de-anonymize the holder. Therefore the holder needs to prove that any credential
                used in presentation is not revoked without disclosing any credential's identifier.
                This is done by adding additional information in the credential (this
                information might be added by the issuer or a separate revocation authority)

        <ul>
          <li>The custom properties in the <a>credential</a> are
          appropriate for the <a>verifier</a>'s purpose. For example if a
          verifier needs to determine that a <a>subject</a> is older than 21
          years of age, they may accept claims of specific
          <code>birthdate</code> or abstract properties such as
          <code>ageOver</code>.</li>
          <li>The <a>issuer</a> is trusted by the <a>verifier</a> to make the
          claims at hand. For example, a franchised Fast Food resturant
          location will trust discount coupon claims made by the
          corporate headquarters of the franchise.</li>
          <li>All policy information expressed by the <a>issuer</a>
          in the <a>verifiable credential</a> MUST be enforced unless
          verifiers accept the risk of not enforcing the policy information.
          For example, the issuer may limit the use
          of the claims to specific <a>verifiers</a>, certain <a>holder</a>
          age ranges, or during certain dates.</li>
          <li>All policy information expressed by the <a>holder</a>
          in the <a>verifiable presentation</a> MUST be enforced unless
          verifiers accept the risk of not enforcing the policy information.
          For example, the holder may limit the use of the claims to
          specific <a>verifiers</a> or for specific purposes
          (such as authentication, but not data mining).</li>

      <h2>Syntaxes</h2>


      <p>
Many of the data model concepts in this document thus far have been introduced
by example using the JSON syntax. This section formalizes how the data model
(described in Sections <a href="#core-data-model"></a>,
<a href="#basic-concepts"></a>, and <a href="#advanced-concepts"></a>
) is realized in JSON and JSON-LD. Although syntactic mappings are only provided for these two syntaxes,
applications and services may also use any other data representation syntax,
such as XML, YAML, or CBOR, that is capable of expressing the data model.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>JSON</h2>

          <p>
The data model as described in Section <a href="#core-data-model"></a> can be
encoded in Javascript Object Notation (JSON) [[!RFC8259]] by mapping
property values to the following JSON types:
          </p>

            <ul>
            <li>Numeric values representable as IEEE754 SHOULD be represented
            as a Number type.</li>
            <li>Any boolean value SHOULD be represented as a Boolean type.</li>
            <li>Any sequence value SHOULD be represented as an Array type.</li>
            <li>Any unordered set of values SHOULD be represented as
              an Array type.</li>
            <li>Any set of <a>properties</a> SHOULD be represented as
              an Object type.</li>
            <li>Any empty value SHOULD be represented as a null value.</li>

        <h2>JSON-LD</h2>

        <p>
[[!JSON-LD]] is a JSON-based format that is used to serialize
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ld-glossary/#linked-data">Linked Data</a>.
The syntax is designed to easily integrate into deployed systems that
already use JSON, and provides a smooth upgrade path from JSON to JSON-LD.
It is primarily intended to be a way to use Linked Data in
Web-based programming environments, to build interoperable Web services,
and to store Linked Data in JSON-based storage engines.
        </p>

        <p>
JSON-LD is useful when extending the data model described in this
specification. Instances of the data model are encoded in JSON-LD in
the same way that they are encoded in JSON (Section <a href="#json"></a>),
with the addition of the <code>@context</code> property. The
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#the-context">JSON-LD Context</a>
is described in detail in the [[!JSON-LD]] specification and its use
is elaborated upon in Section <a href="#extensibility"></a>.
        </p>

        <p>
Multiple contexts MAY be used or combined to express any arbitrary
information about claims in idiomatic JSON. If an application is processing a
<a>verifiable credential</a> or <a>verifiable presentation</a>, and a
<code>@context</code> property is not present at the top-level of the
JSON-LD document, then a <code>@context</code> property with a value of
<code>https://w3id.org/credentials/v1</code> MUST be assumed.

      <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

      <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

      <p>
This section details the general privacy considerations and specific privacy
implications of deploying the verifiable credentials data model into production
environments.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Spectrum of Privacy</h3>
        <p>
It is important to recognize that there is a spectrum of privacy that ranges
from pseudo-anonymous to strongly identified. Depending on the use case,
people have different appetites when it comes to what information they
are willing to provide and what information may be derived from what
is provided.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img style="margin: auto; display: block;" width="80%"
            src="diagrams/privacy-spectrum.svg">
          <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
- Privacy is a spectrum that ranges from pseudo-anonymous to fully identified.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
For example, one would most likely desire to remain anonymous when purchasing
alcohol because the regulatory check that’s required is solely whether or
not the person is above a particular age. However, when a doctor is writing a
prescription for a patient, the pharmacy fulfilling the prescription is
required to more strongly identify the medical professional. Therefore it
is important to recognize that there is not one approach to privacy that
works for all use cases; privacy solutions tend to be use case specific.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
Even if one may desire to remain anonymous when purchasing
alcohol, a photo ID may still be required to provide appropriate
assurance to the merchant. The merchant may not need to know your
name or other details (other than that you are over a certain age),
but in many cases a mere proof of age may still be insufficient to
meet regulations.
        </p>

        <p>
The Verifiable Credentials data model strives to support the full spectrum of
privacy and does not take philosophical positions on the right level of
anonymity for any particular transaction. The following sections provide
guidance for implementers that want to avoid specific scenarios that are
hostile to privacy.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>

        <p>
The data associated with verifiable credentials stored in the
<code>credential.claim</code> field are largely susceptible to privacy
violations when shared with Verifiers. Personally identifying data
such as a government-issued identifier, shipping address, and full name
can be easily used to determine, track, and correlate an entity. Even
information that does not seem personally identifiable like the
combination of a birth date and zip code have very powerful correlation
and de-anonymizing capabilities.
        </p>

        <p>
Implementers are strongly advised to
warn Holders when they share data with these sorts of characteristics.
Issuers are strongly advised to provide privacy-protecting credentials
when possible. For example, issuing ageOver credentials instead of
birthdate credentials when the Verifier desires to determine if an
entity is over the age of 18.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Identifier-based Correlation</h3>

        <p>
Subjects of verifiable credentials are identified via the
<code>credential.claim.id</code> field. The identifiers that are used
to identify the subject of a claim create a danger of correlation when
the identifiers are long-lived or used across more than one web domain.
        </p>
        <p>
If strong anti-correlation properties are a requirement in a system using
verifiable credentials, it is strongly advised that identifiers are bound to a
single origin or that identifiers are single-use or not used at all and
are replaced by short-lived, single use bearer tokens.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Signature-based Correlation</h3>

        <p>
The contents of verifiable credentials are secured via the
<code>credential.proof</code> field. The properties in this field
create a danger of correlation when the same values are used across more than
one session or domain and the value does not change. Examples include the
<code>creator</code>, <code>created</code>,
<code>domain</code> (for very specific domains),
<code>nonce</code>, and <code>signatureValue</code> fields.
        </p>

        <p>
If strong anti-correlation properties are desired,
it is advised that signature values and metadata are regenerated
each time using technologies like third party pairwise signatures,
zero knowledge proofs, or group signatures. It is also important to note
that even when using anti-correlation signatures that information may still
be contained in the credential that defeats the anti-correlation properties
of the cryptography.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Long Lived Identifier-based Correlation</h3>

        <p>
Verifiable <a>credentials</a> may contain long lived identifiers that could
be used to correlate individuals. These types of identifiers include:
subject identifiers, email addresses, government issued identifiers,
organization issued identifiers, addresses, healthcare vitals,
credential-specific JSON-LD Contexts, and many other sorts of long-lived
identifiers.
        </p>

        <p>
Organizations providing software to <a>holders</a> should strive to identify
fields in credentials containing information that could be used to correlate
them and warn the holder when this information is shared.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Device Fingerprinting</h3>

        <p>
There are mechanisms external to Verifiable Credentials that are used to track and
correlate individuals on the Internet and the Web. Some of these mechanisms
include Internet Protocol address tracking, Web Browser fingerprinting,
Evercookies, Advertising Network trackers, mobile network position information,
and in-application Global Positioning System APIs. The use of Verifiable
Claims cannot prevent the use of these other tracking technologies. In addition,
when these technologies are used in concert with Verifiable Credentials, new
correlatable information may be discovered. For example, a birthday coupled
with a GPS position can be used to strongly correlate an individual across
multiple websites.
        </p>

        <p>
It is advised that privacy preserving systems prevent the use of these other
tracking technologies when verifiable credentials are being utilized. In some cases,
these tracking technologies may need to be disabled entirely on devices that
transmit verifiable credentials on behalf of the Holder.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Favor Abstract Claims</h3>

        <p>
In order to enable recipients of verifiable credentials to use them in a variety of circumstances without revealing more personally identifiable information than necessary for the transaction, issuers should consider limiting the information published in a claim to a minimal set needed for the expected purposes.
One way to avoid placing personally identifiable information in a claim is to use an "abstract" property that meets the needs of verifiers without providing specific information about the subject.
        </p>
        <p>
An example in this document is the use of the <code>ageOver</code> property as opposed to a specific birthdate that would constitute much stronger personally identifiable information.
If retailers in a market commonly require purchasers to be older than a specific age, an issuer trusted in that market may choose to offer a credential claiming that subjects have met that requirement as opposed to offering claims of their specific birthdates.
This enables individual customers to purchase items without revealing specific personally identifiable information.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>The Principle of Minimum Disclosure</h3>

        <p>
Privacy violations occur when information divulged in one context leaks into
another. Accepted best practice for preventing such violations is to limit
the information requested, and received, to the absolute minimum necessary.
This minimal disclosure approach is required by regulation in multiple
jurisdictions, including HIPAA in the US and GDPR in the EU.
        </p>
        <p>
With verifiable credentials, minimal disclosure for issuers means limiting the
content of a claim to the minimum required by potential verifiers for
expected use. For verifiers, it means limiting the scope of claims
request or required for accessing services.
        </p>
        <p>
For example, a driver's license containing a driver's ID number,
height, weight, birthday, and home address is an example of a claim set
containing more information than is necessary to establish that the person
is above a certain age.
        </p>

        <p>
It is considered a best practice for issuers to atomize information or
use a signature scheme that allows for selective disclosure.
For example, an issuer
that issues driver's licenses could issue a set of credentials containing every
attribute that appears on a driver's license in addition to atomized
credentials (a credential containing only the person's birthday), and atomized
credentials that are more abstract (a credential containing only an
<code>ageOver</code> attribute). In addition, the issuer is encouraged to
provide secure HTTP endpoints for retrieving single-use bearer credentials to
promote the pseudonymous usage of credentials when it is safe for the issuer to
issue such credentials.
        </p>
        <p>
Similarly, verifiers are urged to only request information that is absolutely
necessary for a particular transaction to occur. This is important for at
least two reasons: 1) it reduces the liability on the verifier for
handling highly sensitive information that it does not need, and 2)
it enhances the privacy of the individual by only asking for information
that is required for the particular transaction.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
While it is possible to practice the Principle of Minimum Disclosure, it may
be impossible to avoid the strong identification of an individual for
specific use cases during a single session or over multiple sessions. The
authors of this document cannot stress how difficult it is to meet this
principle in real world scenarios.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Bearer Credentials</h3>

        <p>
A <em>bearer credential</em> is a privacy enhancing piece of information,
such as a concert ticket, that entitles the <a>holder</a> of the credential to a
particular resource without divulging sensitive information about the holder.
        </p>

        <p>
Verifiable Credentials that are bearer credentials are possible by not
specifying the <a>subject</a> identifier, expressed using the
<code>id</code>property that is nested in the <code>claim</code> property.
For example, the following Verifiable Credential is a bearer credential:
        </p>

        </pre>

        <p>
While bearer credentials can be privacy enhancing, their use must be carefully
crafted to not accidentally divulge more information than the holder of the
credential expects. For example, repeated use of the same bearer credential
across sites enables each site to potentially collude to unduly track or
correlate the holder. Additionally, information that may seem non-identifying
such as a birth date and zip code can be used to statistically identify an
individual when used together in the same credential or session.
        </p>

        <p>
<a>Issuers</a> of bearer credentials SHOULD ensure that bearer credentials that
are expected to provide privacy enhancing benefits 1) are single use, when
possible, 2) do not contain personally identifying information, and 3) are not
unduly correlatable.
        </p>

        <p>
<a>Holders</a> SHOULD be warned by their software if bearer credentials
containing sensitive information are issued or requested, or if there is a
correlation risk when combining two or more bearer credentials across one
or more sessions. While it may be impossible to detect all correlation risks,
some may be detectable.
        </p>

        <p>
<a>Verifiers</a> SHOULD NOT request bearer credentials that can be used to
unduly correlate the user.

      <section>
        <h3>Validity Checks</h3>

        <p>
When processing verifiable credentials, <a>verifiers</a> typically perform
many of the checks listed in Section <a href="#verification"></a> as well as
a variety of business process specific checks. For example, validity checks
may include any of the following:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
Checking the professional licensure status of the holder.
          </li>
          <li>
Checking a date of license renewal or revocation.
          </li>
          <li>
Checking sub-qualifications of an individual.
          </li>
          <li>
Ensuring that a relationship exists between the holder and the entity
with whom the holder is attempting to interact.
          </li>
          <li>
Checking the geolocation information associated with the holder.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
The process of performing these checks may result in information leakage that
leads to a privacy violation of the holder. For example, an operation as
simple as checking a revocation list can notify the issuer that a very specific
business is most likely interacting with the holder. This would enable
issuers to collude and correlate individuals without their knowledge.
        </p>

        <p>
<a>Issuers</a> are urged to not use mechanisms, such as credential revocation
lists that are unique per credential, during the verification process that
would lead to privacy violations. Organizations providing software to
<a>holders</a> should warn when credentials include information that could
lead to privacy violations during the verification process. <a>Verifiers</a>
should consider rejecting credentials that produce privacy violations or that
enable bad privacy practices.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Storage Providers and Data Mining</h3>

        <p>
When a holder receives a claim from an issuer, the
claim will need to be stored somewhere (e.g. in a credential repository).
Holders are warned that the information in a verifiable credential may be
sensitive in nature and highly individualized, making it a high value
target for data mining. Therefore, there may be services
that store verifiable credentials for free and mine personal data and sell it
to organizations that desire individualized profiles on people and
organizations (i.e. if the service is free, you are the product).
        </p>
        <p>
It is suggested that holders be aware of the terms of service for their
credential repository, specifically the correlation and data mining
protections that are in place for those who store their verifiable credentials
at the service provider.
        </p>
        <p>
There are a number of effective mitigations for data mining and profiling:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
Use service providers that do not sell your information to third parties.
          </li>
          <li>
Use software that encrypts verifiable credentials such that a service provider
cannot view the contents of the claims.
          </li>
          <li>
Use software that stores verifiable credentials locally on a device that you
control and that does not upload or analyze your information beyond
your expectations.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Aggregation of Credentials</h3>

        <p>
Two pieces of information about the same <a>subject</a> almost always reveals
more information than just a single piece of information, even when delivered
through different channels. The aggregation of credentials is a privacy risk and
all participants in the ecosystem need to be aware of the risks of data
aggregation.
        </p>

        <p>
For example, if a bearer credential for an email address and then a bearer
credential
stating that the holder is over the age of 21 are provided across multiple
sessions, the verifier of the information has 1) a unique identifier to
associate with the individual, and 2) age related information for that
individual. It then becomes trivial to
create a profile for the holder such that more and more information is leaked
over time. Aggregation of credentials can be performed across multiple sites that
are colluding as well, leading to privacy violations.
        </p>

        <p>
Preventing the aggregation of information is a very difficult privacy problem
to address from a technological perspective. While new cryptographic techniques,
such as zero knowledge proofs, have been proposed as solutions to the problem
of aggregation and correlation, the existence of long-lived identifiers
and browser tracking techniques easily defeat even the most modern
cryptographic techniques.
        </p>

        <p>
The solution to the privacy implications of correlation or aggregation tend
to not be technological in nature, but policy driven instead. Therefore, if
a holder does not wish information to be aggregated about them, then they
must express this in the <a>verifiable presentations</a> that they transmit.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Usage Patterns</h3>

        <p>
Despite the best efforts to assure privacy, the actual use of verifiable
credentials can potentially lead to de-anonymization and a loss of privacy.
This correlation can occur:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
When the same claim is presented to the same verifier more than once –
that verifier could infer that the holder is the same individual.
          </li>
          <li>
When the same claim is presented to different verifiers, and either those
verifiers collude or a third party has access to transaction records from
both verifiers – the observant party could infer that the individual
presenting the claims is the same person at both services, i.e., the
accounts are controlled by the same person.
          </li>
          <li>
When the same subject identifier of a claim refers to the same subject across
presentations or verifiers. Even when different claims are presented,
if the subject identifier is the same, verifiers (and those with access to
verifier logs) could infer that the holder of the claims is the same
person.
          </li>
          <li>
When the underlying information in a claim can be used to identify an
individual across services – using information from other sources
(including information provided directly by the user), verifiers can use
the information inside the claim to correlate the individual with an
existing profile. For example, if a holder presents claims that include
zip code, age, and sex, the verifier can potentially correlate the
subject of that claim with an established profile [see Sweeney 2000 <a href="http://dataprivacylab.org/projects/identifiability/paper1.pdf">Simple
            Demographics Often Identify People Uniquely</a>].
          </li>
          <li>
When passing the identifier of a claim to a centralized revocation server – the
centralized server can correlate the claim usage across interactions. For
example, if a verifiable credential is used for proof of age in this manner, the
centralized service could know everywhere that claim was presented: all
liquor stores, bars, adult stores, lottery purchases, etc.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
It’s possible to mitigate this in part:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
Use a globally unique identifier as the subject for any given claim and never
re-use that claim.
          </li>
          <li>
If the claim supports revocation, use a globally distributed service for revocation.
          </li>
          <li>
Design revocation APIs that do not depend on submitting the ID
of the claim, e.g., use a revocation list rather than a query.
          </li>
          <li>
Avoid associating personally identifiable information with any particular
long-lived subject identifier.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
It is understood that these mitigation techniques are not always practical
or even compatible with necessary usage. Sometimes correlation is the point.
        </p>
        <p>
In state prescription monitoring programs, usage monitoring is a
requirement: enforcement entities need to be able to confirm that
individuals are not cheating the system to get multiple prescriptions
for controlled substances. This statutory or regulatory need to correlate
usage overrides individual privacy concerns.
        </p>

        <p>
Verifiable claims will so be used to intentionally correlate individuals
across services, for example, when using a common persona to log in to
multiple services, so all activity on each of those services is
intentionally linked to the same individual. This is not a privacy issue
as long as each of those services uses the correlation in the expected
manner.
        </p>

        <p>
Privacy risks of claim usage occur when unintended or unexpected
correlation arises from the presentation of verifiable credentials.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Sharing Information with the Wrong Party</h3>

        <p>
When a <a>holder</a> chooses to share information with a <a>verifier</a>, it
may be the case that the verifier is acting in bad faith and requests
information that could be used to harm the holder. For example, a
verifier may ask for a bank account number, which could then be used in
concert with other information to defraud the holder or the bank.
        </p>

        <p>
<a>Issuers</a> should strive to tokenize as much information as possible such
that if a holder accidentally transmits credentials to the wrong
verifier that the information loss isn't catastrophic.
        </p>

        <p>
For example, instead of including a bank account number
for the purposes of checking a bank balance for an individual, provide a
token that enables the verifier to use the token to check to see if the
balance is above a certain amount. In this case, the bank could
issue a verifiable credential containing a token for checking balance
to a holder. A holder would then include the verifiable credential in a
verifiable presentation and bind the token to a credit checking agency via a digital
signature. The verifier would then wrap the verifiable presentation in their digital
signature, and hand it back to the issuer to dynamically check the account
balance.
        </p>

        <p>
This approach ensures that even if the holder shares the account balance token
with the wrong party that the attacker doesn't discover the bank account
number, nor the exact value in the account, and given the validity period for
the counter-signature, doesn't gain access to the token for more than a few
minutes.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Frequency of Claim Issuance</h3>

        <p>
As Section <a href="#usage-patterns"></a> details, usage patterns can be
correlated into certain types of behavior. Part of this correlation is
mitigated when a <a>holder</a> uses a verifiable credential without the
knowledge of the <a>issuer</a>. Issuers may defeat this protection by making
their claims short lived and renewal automatic.
        </p>

        <p>
For example, an "over the age of 21" credential may be useful when gaining
access to a bar. If an issuer makes the credential have a very short expiration
date and an automatic renewal mechanism, then they could possibly correlate
the holder's behavior in a way that negatively impacts the holder.
        </p>

        <p>
Organizations providing software to holders should warn <a>holders</a> if they
repeatedly use credentials with short lifespans that could result in
behavior correlation. Issuers should avoid issuing claims in a way that
enables them to correlate usage patterns.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Prefer Single Use Credentials</h3>

        <p>
An ideal privacy respecting system would only require information to be
disclosed by the holder that is necessary for the interaction with the verifier.
The verifier would then record that the disclosure requirement was met and
forget any sensitive information that was disclosed. In many cases,
competing priorities, such as regulatory burden, prevent this ideal system
from being employed.
In other cases, long-lived identifiers prevent single use.
The design of any verifiable credentials ecosystem, however, should strive to
be as privacy respecting as possible by preferring single use credentials
when possible.
        </p>

        <p>
The usage of these type of credentials provides several benefits. The first
benefit is to verifiers who can be sure that the data in the credential is
fresh. The second benefit is to holders, who know that if there are no long
lived identifiers in the credential that the credential itself cannot be used
to track or correlate them online. Finally, the third benefit ensures that
there is nothing for attackers to steal, making the entire ecosystem safer
to operate within.

      <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

      <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

      <p>
There are a number of security considerations that <a>issuers</a>,
<a>holders</a>, and <a>verifiers</a> should be aware of when processing
data described by this specification. Ignoring or not understanding the
implications of this section can result in security vulnerabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
While this section attempts to highlight a broad set of security
considerations, it should not be interpreted as a complete list of all
security considerations. Implementers are urged to seek the advice of security
and cryptography professionals when implementing mission critical systems
using the technology outlined in this specification.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Cryptography Suites and Libraries</h3>

        <p>
Some aspects of the data model described in this specification can be
protected through the use of cryptography.
Implementers should be aware of the underlying
cryptography suites and libraries that are used to implement the
creation and verification of digital signatures and mathematical proofs
utilized by their systems when processing <a>credentials</a> and
<a>presentations</a>. Software developers with extensive experience implementing
or auditing systems that use cryptography must be used to ensure that
systems are properly designed. Proper
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team">red teaming</a>
is also suggested to remove bias from security reviews.
        </p>

        <p>
Cryptography suites and libraries have a shelf life and eventually fall to
new attacks and technology advances. Any production quality system must take
this reality into account and ensure that mechanisms exist to easily upgrade
old or broken cryptographic suites and libraries in a proactive manner.
Mechanisms should also exist to invalidate and replace existing credentials
in the event of a cryptography suite or library failure.
Regular monitoring of systems to ensure proper upgrades are made in a timely
manner are also important to ensure the long term viability of systems
processing verifiable credentials.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Unsigned Claims</h3>

        <p>
This specification allows <a>credentials</a> to be produced that do not
contain signatures or proofs of any kind. These types of credentials are often
useful for intermediate storage, or self asserted information, which is
analogous to filling out a form on a web page. Implementers should note that
these types of credentials are not verifiable because the authorship
is either not known or cannot be trusted.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Bundling Dependent Claims</h3>
        <p>
It is considered a best practice for issuers to atomize information in a
credential, or use a signature scheme that allows for selective disclosure.
In the former case, if the atomization is not done securely by the issuer,
the holder might bundle together different credentials in a way that was not
intended by the issuer.
        </p>
        <p>
For example a university might issue two credentials to a person, each
containing two properties i.e. "Staff Member" in the
"Department of Computing" and "Post Graduate Student" in the
"Department of Economics". If these credentials are atomized into separate
properties, then the university would issue four credentials to the person,
each containing one of the following properties:
"Staff Member", "Post Graduate Student", "Department of Computing" and
"Department of Economics". The holder could then transfer
the "Staff Member" and "Department of Economics" to an inspector-verifier,
which together would comprise a false claim.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Token Binding</h2>
        <p>
A <a>verifier</a> may need to ensure that they are the intended recipient
of a <a>verifiable presentation</a> and are not the target of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">
man in the middle attack</a>. Any protocol that utilizes the
Verifiable Credentials Data Model and requires protection against these
sorts of attacks needs to perform some sort of token binding, such
as using <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tokbind-protocol-18">
The Token Binding Protocol v1.0</a>, that ties
the request for a <a>verifiable presentation</a> with the response. Any
protocol that does not perform token binding is susceptible to
man in the middle attacks.

      <section>
        <h3>Highly Dynamic Information</h3>

        <p>
When verifiable <a>credentials</a> are issued for highly dynamic information,
implementers should ensure that the expiration times for the credential are
set appropriately. Expiration periods that are longer than the timeframe
where the credential is valid may create exploitable security vulnerabilities.
Expiration periods that are shorter than the timeframe where the information
expressed by the credential is valid create a burden on <a>holders</a> and
<a>verifiers</a>. It is therefore important to set validity periods for
credentials that are appropriate to the use case and the expected lifetime
for the information contained in the credential.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Device Theft and Impersonation</h3>

        <p>
When <a>verifiable credentials</a> are stored on a device and that
device is stolen by an attacker, it may be possible for the attacker to then
gain access to systems using the victim's verifiable credentials. Mitigations
for this attack include:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
Enabling password, pin, pattern, or biometric screen unlock protection.
          </li>
          <li>
Enabling password, biometric, or multi-factor authentication for the
credential repository.
          </li>
          <li>
Enabling password, biometric, or multi-factor authentication when
accessing cryptographic keys.
          </li>
          <li>
Utilizing a separate hardware-based signature device.
          </li>
          <li>
All or any combination of the above.
          </li>
        </ul>
