      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
<a>Credentials</a> are a part of our daily lives; driver's licenses are used to
assert that we are capable of operating a motor vehicle, university degrees
can be used to assert our level of education, and government-issued passports
enable us to travel between countries. These <a>credentials</a> provide
benefits to us when used in the physical world, but their use on the Web
continues to be elusive.
      </p>

      <p>
Currently it is difficult to express education qualifications, healthcare
data, financial account details, and other sorts of third-party <a>verified</a>
machine-readable personal information on the Web. The difficulty of expressing
digital <a>credentials</a> on the Web makes it challenging to receive the same
benefits through the Web that physical <a>credentials</a> provide us in the
physical world.
      </p>

      <p>
This specification provides a standard way to express <a>credentials</a> on the
Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and
machine-verifiable.
      </p>

      <p>
For those unfamiliar with the concepts related to
<a>verifiable credentials</a>, the following sections provide an overview of:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
The components that constitute a <a>verifiable credential</a>
        </li>
        <li>
The components that constitute a <a>verifiable presentation</a>
        </li>
        <li>
An ecosystem where <a>verifiable credentials</a> and
<a>verifiable presentations</a> are expected to be useful
        </li>
        <li>
The use cases and requirements that informed this specification.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>What is a Verifiable Credential?</h3>

        <p>
In the physical world, a <a>credential</a> might consist of:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
Information related to identifying the <a>subject</a> of the <a>credential</a>
(for example, a photo, name, or identification number)
          </li>
          <li>
Information related to the issuing authority (for example, a city government,
national agency, or certification body)
          </li>
          <li>
Information related to the type of <a>credential</a> this is (for example, a
Dutch passport, an American driving license, or a health insurance card)
          </li>
          <li>
Information related to specific attributes or properties being asserted by
the issuing authority about the <a>subject</a> (for example, nationality,
the classes of vehicle entitled to drive, or date of birth)
          </li>
          <li>
Evidence related to how the <a>credential</a> was derived
          </li>
          <li>
Information related to constraints on the credential (for example,
validity period, or terms of use).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
A <a>verifiable credential</a> can represent all of the same information that a
physical <a>credential</a> represents. The addition of technologies, such as
digital signatures, makes <a>verifiable credentials</a> more tamper-evident and
more trustworthy than their physical counterparts.
        </p>

        <p>
<a>Holders</a> of <a>verifiable credentials</a> can generate
<a>verifiable presentations</a> and then share these
<a>verifiable presentations</a> with <a>verifiers</a> to prove they possess
<a>verifiable credentials</a> with certain characteristics.
        </p>

        <p>
Both <a>verifiable credentials</a> and <a>verifiable presentations</a> can be
transmitted rapidly, making them more convenient than their physical
counterparts when trying to establish trust at a distance.
        </p>

        <p>
While this specification attempts to improve the ease of expressing digital
<a>credentials</a>, it also attempts to balance this goal with a number of
privacy-preserving goals. The persistence of digital information, and the ease
with which disparate sources of digital data can be collected and correlated,
comprise a privacy concern that the use of <a>verifiable</a> and easily
machine-readable <a>credentials</a> threatens to make worse. This document
outlines and attempts to address a number of these issues in Section
<a href="#privacy-considerations"></a>. Examples of how to use this data model
using privacy-enhancing technologies, such as zero-knowledge proofs, are also
provided throughout this document.
        </p>

        <p>
The word "verifiable" in the terms
<a>verifiable credential</a> and <a>verifiable presentation</a>
refers to the characteristic of a <a>credential</a> or <a>presentation</a>
as being able to be <a>verified</a> by a <a>verifier</a>,
as defined in this document. Verifiability of a credential does not imply
that the truth of <a>claims</a> encoded therein can be evaluated; however,
the issuer can include values in the <a>evidence</a> property to help the verifier
apply their business logic to determine whether the claims have sufficient
veracity for their needs.
        </p>

        <h3>Ecosystem Overview</h3>

        <p>
This section describes the roles of the core actors and the relationships
between them in an ecosystem where <a>verifiable credentials</a> are expected
to be useful. A role is an abstraction that might be implemented in many
different ways. The separation of roles suggests likely interfaces and
protocols for standardization. The following roles are introduced in this
specification:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><a>holder</a></dt>
          <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> might perform by possessing one or more
<a>verifiable credentials</a> and generating <a>verifiable presentations</a>
from them. Example holders include students, employees, and customers.
          </dd>
          <dt><a>issuer</a></dt>
          <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> performs by asserting <a>claims</a> about one or
more <a>subjects</a>, creating a <a>verifiable credential</a> from these
<a>claims</a>, and transmitting the <a>verifiable credential</a> to a
<a>holder</a>. Example issuers include corporations, non-profit organizations,
trade associations, governments, and individuals.
          </dd>
          <dt><a>subject</a></dt>
          <dd>
An <a>entity</a> about which <a>claims</a> are made. Example subjects include
human beings, animals, and things. In many cases the <a>holder</a> of a
<a>verifiable credential</a> is the subject, but in certain cases it is not. For
example, a parent (the <a>holder</a>) might hold the
<a>verifiable credentials</a> of a child (the <a>subject</a>), or a pet owner
(the <a>holder</a>) might hold the <a>verifiable credentials</a> of their pet
(the <a>subject</a>). For more information about these special cases, see the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-imp-guide/#subject-holder-relationships">
Subject-Holder Relationships</a> section in the Verifiable Credentials
Implementation Guide [[VC-IMP-GUIDE]].
          </dd>
          <dt><a>verifier</a></dt>
          <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> performs by receiving one or more
<a>verifiable credentials</a>, optionally inside a
<a>verifiable presentation</a>, for processing. Example verifiers include
employers, security personnel, and websites.
          </dd>
          <dt><a>verifiable data registry</a></dt>
          <dd>
A role a system might perform by mediating the creation and <a>verification</a>
of identifiers, keys, and other relevant data, such as
<a>verifiable credential</a> schemas, revocation registries, issuer public keys,
and so on, which might be required to use <a>verifiable credentials</a>. Some
configurations might require correlatable identifiers for <a>subjects</a>.
Example verifiable data registries include trusted databases, decentralized
databases, government ID databases, and distributed ledgers. Often
there is more than one type of verifiable data registry utilized in an
ecosystem.

protected environments or proprietary systems, where
<a>verifiable credentials</a> also provide benefit.

        <h3>Use Cases and Requirements</h3>

        <p>
The Verifiable Credentials Use Cases document [[VC-USE-CASES]] outlines a number
of key topics that readers might find useful, including:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>

          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
As a result of documenting and analyzing the use cases document, the following
desirable ecosystem characteristics were identified for this specification:
        </p>
<!-- requirement list start -->
        <ul>
          <li>
<a>Credentials</a> represent statements made by an <a>issuer</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Verifiable credentials</a> represent statements made by an <a>issuer</a> in
a tamper-evident and privacy-respecting manner.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Holders</a> assemble collections of <a>credentials</a> and/or
<a>verifiable credentials</a> from different <a>issuers</a> into a single
artifact, a <a>presentation</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
Holders transform <a>presentations</a> into <a>verifiable presentations</a>
to render them tamper-evident.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Issuers</a> can issue <a>verifiable credentials</a> about any <a>subject</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
Acting as <a>issuer</a>, <a>holder</a>, or <a>verifier</a> requires neither
registration nor approval by any authority, as the trust involved is bilateral
between parties.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Verifiable presentations</a> allow any <a>verifier</a> to <a>verify</a> the
authenticity of <a>verifiable credentials</a> from any <a>issuer</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Holders</a> can receive <a>verifiable credentials</a> from anyone.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Holders</a> can interact with any <a>issuer</a> and any <a>verifier</a>
through any user agent.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Holders</a> can share <a>verifiable presentations</a>, which can then be
<a>verified</a> without revealing the identity of the <a>verifier</a> to the
<a>issuer</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Holders</a> can store <a>verifiable credentials</a> in any location, without
affecting their <a>verifiability</a> and without the <a>issuer</a> knowing
anything about where they are stored or when they are accessed.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Holders</a> can present <a>verifiable presentations</a> to any
<a>verifier</a> without affecting authenticity of the claims and without
revealing that action to the <a>issuer</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
A <a>verifier</a> can <a>verify</a> <a>verifiable presentations</a> from any
<a>holder</a>, containing proofs of <a>claims</a> from any <a>issuer</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Verification</a> should not depend on direct interactions between
<a>issuers</a> and <a>verifiers</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Verification</a> should not reveal the identity of the <a>verifier</a> to
any <a>issuer</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
The specification must provide a means for <a>issuers</a> to issue
<a>verifiable credentials</a> that support selective disclosure, without
requiring all conformant software to support that feature.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Issuers</a> can issue <a>verifiable credentials</a> that support
selective disclosure.
          </li>
          <li>
If a single <a>verifiable credential</a> supports selective disclosure, then
<a>holders</a> can present proofs of <a>claims</a> without revealing the entire
<a>verifiable credential</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Verifiable presentations</a> can either disclose the attributes of a
<a>verifiable credential</a>, or satisfy <a>derived predicates</a> requested by
the <a>verifier</a>. <a>Derived predicates</a> are Boolean conditions, such as
greater than, less than, equal to, is in set, and so on.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Issuers</a> can issue revocable <a>verifiable credentials</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
The processes of cryptographically protecting <a>credentials</a> and
<a>presentations</a>, and verifying <a>verifiable credentials</a> and
<a>verifiable presentations</a>, have to be deterministic, bi-directional, and
lossless. Any verification of a <a>verifiable credential</a> or
<a>verifiable presentation</a> has to be transformable to the generic data model
defined in this document in a deterministic process, such that the resulting
<a>credential</a> or <a>presentation</a> is semantically and syntactically
equivalent to the original construct, so that it can be processed in an
interoperable fashion.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Verifiable credentials</a> and <a>verifiable presentations</a> have to be
serializable in one or more machine-readable data formats. The process of
serialization and/or de-serialization has to be deterministic, bi-directional,
and lossless. Any serialization of a <a>verifiable credential</a> or
<a>verifiable presentation</a> needs to be transformable to the generic data
model defined in this document in a deterministic process such that the
resulting <a>verifiable credential</a> can be processed in an interoperable
fashion. The serialized form also needs to be able to be generated from the data
model without loss of data or content.
          </li>
          <li>
The data model and serialization must be extendable with minimal coordination.
          </li>
          <li>
Revocation by the <a>issuer</a> should not reveal any identifying information
about the <a>subject</a>, the <a>holder</a>, the specific
<a>verifiable credential</a>, or the <a>verifier</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Issuers</a> can disclose the revocation reason.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Issuers</a> revoking <a>verifiable credentials</a> should distinguish between
revocation for cryptographic integrity (for example, the signing key is
compromised) versus revocation for a status change (for example, the driver's
license is suspended).
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Issuers</a> can provide a service for refreshing a
<a>verifiable credential</a>.

      <section id="conformance" class="normative">
        <p>
A <dfn>conforming document</dfn> is any concrete expression of the data model
that complies with the normative statements in this specification.
Specifically, all relevant normative statements in Sections
<a href="#basic-concepts"></a>, <a href="#advanced-concepts"></a>, and
<a href="#syntaxes"></a> of this document MUST be enforced. A serialization
format for the conforming document MUST be deterministic, bi-directional,
and lossless as described in Section <a href="#syntaxes"></a>.
The <a>conforming document</a> MAY be transmitted or stored in any such
serialization format.
        </p>

        <p>
A <dfn class="lint-ignore">conforming processor</dfn> is any algorithm realized
as software and/or hardware that generates or consumes a <a>conforming
document</a>. Conforming processors MUST produce errors when non-conforming
documents are consumed.
        </p>

        <p>
This specification makes no normative statements with regard to the
conformance of roles in the ecosystem, such as <a>issuers</a>, <a>holders</a>,
or <a>verifiers</a>, because the conformance of ecosystem roles are highly
application, use case, and market vertical specific.
        </p>

        <p>
Digital proof mechanisms, a subset of which are digital signatures, are required
to ensure the protection of a <a>verifiable credential</a>. Having and
validating proofs, which may be dependent on the syntax of the proof
(for example, using the JSON Web Signature of a JSON Web Token for proofing a
key holder), are an essential part of processing a <a>verifiable credential</a>.
At the time of publication, Working Group members had implemented
<a>verifiable credentials</a> using at least three proof mechanisms:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
Securing Verifiable Credentials using JSON Web Tokens [[VC-JWT]].
          </li>
          <li>
Securing Verifiable Credentials using Data Integrity Proofs [[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]].
          </li>
          <li>
Camenisch-Lysyanskaya Zero-Knowledge Proofs [[?CL-SIGNATURES]].
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
Implementers are advised to note that not all proof mechanisms are standardized
as of the publication date of this specification. The group expects some of
these mechanisms, as well as new ones, to mature independently and become
standardized in time. Given there are multiple valid proof mechanisms, this
specification does not standardize on any single digital signature mechanism.
One of the goals of this specification is to provide a data model that can be
protected by a variety of current and future digital proof mechanisms.
Conformance to this specification does not depend on the details of a particular
proof mechanism; it requires clearly identifying the mechanism a
<a>verifiable credential</a> uses.
        </p>

        <p>
This document also contains examples that contain JSON and JSON-LD content.
Some of these examples contain characters that are invalid JSON, such as
inline comments (<code>//</code>) and the use of ellipsis (<code>...</code>)
to denote information that adds little value to the example. Implementers are
cautioned to remove this content if they desire to use the information as
valid JSON or JSON-LD.

      <h2>Core Data Model</h2>

      <p>
The following sections outline core data model concepts, such as <a>claims</a>,
<a>credentials</a>, and <a>presentations</a>, which form the foundation of this
specification.
      </p>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Claims</h3>

        <p>
A <a>claim</a> is a statement about a <a>subject</a>. A <a>subject</a> is a
thing about which <a>claims</a> can be made. <a>Claims</a> are expressed using
<strong><em>subject</em></strong>-<dfn data-lt="property|properties">
property</dfn>-<dfn class="lint-ignore">value</dfn> relationships.
        </p>

        <figure id="basic-structure">

            has a value">
          <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
The basic structure of a claim.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
The data model for <a>claims</a>, illustrated in <a href="#basic-structure"></a>
above, is powerful and can be used to express a large variety of statements. For
example, whether someone graduated from a particular university can be expressed
as shown in <a href="#basic-example"></a> below.
        </p>

        <figure id="basic-example">
          <img style="margin: auto; display: block; width: 60%;"
            src="diagrams/claim-example.svg" alt="Pat has an alumniOf
            property whose value is Example University">
          <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
A basic claim expressing that Pat is an alumni of "Example University".
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
Individual <a>claims</a> can be merged together to express a <a>graph</a> of
information about a <a>subject</a>. The example shown in
<a href="#multiple-claims"></a> below extends the previous <a>claim</a> by
adding the <a>claims</a> that Pat knows Sam and that Sam is employed as a
professor.
        </p>

        <figure id="multiple-claims">
          <img style="margin: auto; display: block; width: 75%;"
            src="diagrams/claim-extended.svg" alt="extends previous

Multiple claims can be combined to express a graph of information.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
To this point, the concepts of a <a>claim</a> and a <a>graph</a> of information
are introduced. To be able to trust <a>claims</a>, more information is
expected to be added to the graph.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Credentials</h3>

        <p>
A <a>credential</a> is a set of one or more <a>claims</a> made by the same
<a>entity</a>. <a>Credentials</a> might also include an identifier and metadata
to describe properties of the <a>credential</a>, such as the
<a>issuer</a>, the validity date and time period, a representative image, a
public key to use for <a>verification</a> purposes, the revocation mechanism,
and so on. The metadata might be signed by the <a>issuer</a>. A
<a>verifiable credential</a> is a set of tamper-evident <a>claims</a> and
metadata that cryptographically prove who issued it.

        <p>
Examples of <a>verifiable credentials</a> include digital employee
identification cards, digital birth certificates, and digital educational
certificates.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
<a>Credential</a> identifiers are often used to identify specific instances
of a <a>credential</a>. These identifiers can also be used for correlation. A
<a>holder</a> wanting to minimize correlation is advised to use a selective
disclosure scheme that does not reveal the <a>credential</a> identifier.
        </p>

        <p>
<a href="#basic-vc"></a> above shows the basic components of a
<a>verifiable credential</a>, but abstracts the details about how <a>claims</a>
are organized into information <a>graphs</a>, which are then organized into
<a>verifiable credentials</a>. <a href="#info-graph-vc"></a> below shows a
more complete depiction of a <a>verifiable credential</a>, which is normally
composed of at least two information <a>graphs</a>. The first <a>graph</a>
expresses the <a>verifiable credential</a> itself, which contains credential
metadata and <a>claims</a>. The second <a>graph</a> expresses the digital proof,
which is usually a digital signature.

        <h3>Presentations</h3>

        <p>
Enhancing privacy is a key design feature of this specification. Therefore, it
is important for <a>entities</a> using this technology to be able to express
only the portions of their persona that are appropriate for a given situation.
The expression of a subset of one's persona is called a
<a>verifiable presentation</a>. Examples of different personas include a
person's professional persona, their online gaming persona, their
family persona, or an incognito persona.
        </p>

        <p>
A <a>verifiable presentation</a> expresses data from one or more
<a>verifiable credentials</a>, and is packaged in such a way that the
authorship of the data is <a>verifiable</a>. If <a>verifiable credentials</a>
are presented directly, they become <a>verifiable presentations</a>. Data
formats derived from <a>verifiable credentials</a> that are cryptographically
<a>verifiable</a>, but do not of themselves contain
<a>verifiable credentials</a>, might also be <a>verifiable presentations</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
The data in a <a>presentation</a> is often about the same <a>subject</a>, but
might have been issued by multiple <a>issuers</a>. The aggregation of this
information typically expresses an aspect of a person, organization, or
<a>entity</a>.

second information <a>graphs</a>, i.e., a self-contained Credential
<a>Graph</a>, which in turn contains credential metadata and claims. The

information <a>graph</a>, the Presentation Proof <a>Graph</a>, expresses the
presentation graph proof, which is usually a digital signature.

        <h3>Concrete Lifecycle Example</h3>

        <p>
The previous sections introduced the concepts of <a>claims</a>,
<a>verifiable credentials</a>, and <a>verifiable presentations</a> using
graphical depictions. This section provides a concrete set of simple but
complete lifecycle examples of the data model expressed in one of the concrete
syntaxes supported by this specification. The lifecycle of <a>credentials</a>
and <a>presentations</a> in the
<a href="#ecosystem-overview">Verifiable Credentials Ecosystem</a> often
take a common path:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
Issuance of one or more <a>verifiable credentials</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
Storage of <a>verifiable credentials</a> in a <a>credential repository</a>
(such as a digital wallet).
          </li>
          <li>
Composition of <a>verifiable credentials</a> into a
<a>verifiable presentation</a> for <a>verifiers</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Verification</a> of the <a>verifiable presentation</a> by the
<a>verifier</a>.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
To illustrate this lifecycle, we will use the example of redeeming an alumni
discount from a university. In the example below, Pat receives an alumni
<a>verifiable credential</a> from a university, and Pat stores the
<a>verifiable credential</a> in a digital wallet.

Pat then attempts to redeem the alumni discount. The <a>verifier</a>, a ticket
sales system, states that any alumni of "Example University" receives a discount
on season tickets to sporting events. Using a mobile device, Pat starts the
process of purchasing a season ticket. A step in this process requests an alumni
<a>verifiable credential</a>, and this request is routed to Pat's digital wallet.
The digital wallet asks Pat if they would like to provide a previously issued

      <h2>Basic Concepts</h2>

      <p>
This section introduces some basic concepts for the specification, in
preparation for Section <a href="#advanced-concepts"></a> later in the
document.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Contexts</h3>

        <p>
When two software systems need to exchange data, they need to use terminology
that both systems understand. As an analogy, consider how two people
communicate. Both people must use the same language and the words they use must
mean the same thing to each other. This might be referred to as
<em>the context of a conversation</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
<a>Verifiable credentials</a> and <a>verifiable presentations</a> have many
attributes and values that are identified by <a>URLs</a> [[URL]]. However,
those <a>URLs</a> can be long and not very human-friendly. In such cases,
short-form human-friendly aliases can be more helpful. This specification uses
the <code>@context</code> <a>property</a> to map such short-form aliases to the
<a>URLs</a> required by specific <a>verifiable credentials</a> and <a>verifiable
presentations</a>.
       </p>
  <p class="note">
In JSON-LD, the <code>@context</code> <a>property</a> can also be used to
communicate other details, such as datatype information, language information,
transformation rules, and so on, which are beyond the needs of this
specification, but might be useful in the future or to related work. For more
information, see
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#the-context">Section 3.1: The Context</a>
of the [[JSON-LD]] specification.
        </p>
        <p>
<a>Verifiable credentials</a> and <a>verifiable presentations</a> MUST include a
<code>@context</code> <a>property</a>.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn class="lint-ignore">@context</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
The value of the <code>@context</code> <a>property</a> MUST be an ordered set
where the first item is a <a>URL</a> with the value
<code>https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2</code>. For reference, a copy of
the base context is provided in Appendix <a href="#base-context"></a>.
Subsequent items in the array MUST express context information and be composed
of any combination of <a>URLs</a> or objects. It is RECOMMENDED that each
<a>URL</a> in the <code>@context</code> be one which, if dereferenced, results
in a document containing machine-readable information about the
<code>@context</code>.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p class="note">
Though this specification requires that a <code>@context</code> <a>property</a>
be present, it is not required that the value of the <code>@context</code>
<a>property</a> be processed using JSON-LD. This is to support processing using
plain JSON libraries, such as those that might be used when the
<a>verifiable credential</a> is encoded as a JWT. All libraries or processors
MUST ensure that the order of the values in the <code>@context</code>
<a>property</a> is what is expected for the specific application. Libraries or
processors that support JSON-LD can process the <code>@context</code>
<a>property</a> using full JSON-LD processing as expected.

        <p>
The example above uses the base context <a>URL</a>
(<code>https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2</code>) to establish that the
conversation is about a <a>verifiable credential</a>. The second <a>URL</a>
(<code>https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2</code>) establishes that
the conversation is about examples.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
This document uses the example context <a>URL</a>
(<code>https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2</code>) for the purpose
of demonstrating examples. Implementations are expected to not use this
<a>URL</a> for any other purpose, such as in pilot or production systems.
        </p>

        <p>
The data available at <code>https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2</code> is a
static document that is never updated and SHOULD be downloaded and cached. The
associated human-readable vocabulary document for the Verifiable Credentials
Data Model is available at
<a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/">https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/</a>.
This concept is further expanded on in Section <a href="#extensibility"></a>.

        <h3>Identifiers</h3>

        <p>
When expressing statements about a specific thing, such as a person, product,
or organization, it is often useful to use some kind of identifier so that
others can express statements about the same thing. This specification defines
the optional <code>id</code> <a>property</a> for such identifiers. The
<code>id</code> <a>property</a> is intended to unambiguously refer to an object,
such as a person, product, or organization. Using the <code>id</code>
<a>property</a> allows for the expression of statements about specific things in
the <a>verifiable credential</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
<em>If</em> the <code>id</code> <a>property</a> is present:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
The <code>id</code> <a>property</a> MUST express an identifier that others are
expected to use when expressing statements about a specific thing identified
by that identifier.
          </li>
          <li>
The <code>id</code> <a>property</a> MUST NOT have more than one value.
          </li>
          <li>
The value of the <code>id</code> <a>property</a> MUST be a <a>URL</a> which
MAY be dereferenced.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="note">
Developers should remember that identifiers might be harmful in scenarios
where pseudonymity is required. Developers are encouraged to read Section
<a href="#identifier-based-correlation"></a> carefully when considering such
scenarios. There are also other types of correlation mechanisms documented in
Section <a href="#privacy-considerations"></a> that create privacy concerns.
Where privacy is a strong consideration, the <code>id</code> <a>property</a>
MAY be omitted.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn class="lint-ignore">id</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
The value of the <code>id</code> <a>property</a> MUST be a single <a>URL</a>.
It is RECOMMENDED that the <a>URL</a> in the <code>id</code> be one which, if
dereferenced, results in a document containing machine-readable information
about the <code>id</code>.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <pre class="example nohighlight vc" title="Usage of the id property"
          data-vc-vm="https://example.edu/issuers/565049#key-1">

  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2"
  ],

      "name": "Bachelor of Science and Arts"
    }
  }
}
        </pre>

        <p>
The example above uses two types of identifiers. The first identifier is for
the <a>verifiable credential</a> and uses an HTTP-based URL. The second
identifier is for the <a>subject</a> of the <a>verifiable credential</a> (the
thing the <a>claims</a> are about) and uses a <a>decentralized identifier</a>,
also known as a <a>DID</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
As of this publication, <a>DIDs</a> are a new type of identifier that are not
necessary for <a>verifiable credentials</a> to be useful. Specifically,
<a>verifiable credentials</a> do not depend on <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DIDs</a> do
not depend on <a>verifiable credentials</a>. However, it is expected that many
<a>verifiable credentials</a> will use <a>DIDs</a> and that software libraries
implementing this specification will probably need to resolve <a>DIDs</a>.
<a>DID</a>-based URLs are used for expressing identifiers associated with
<a>subjects</a>, <a>issuers</a>, <a>holders</a>, credential status lists,
cryptographic keys, and other machine-readable information associated with a
<a>verifiable credential</a>.

        <h3>Types</h3>

        <p>
Software systems that process the kinds of objects specified in this document
use type information to determine whether or not a provided
<a>verifiable credential</a> or <a>verifiable presentation</a> is appropriate
for the intended use case. This specification defines a <code>type</code>
<a>property</a> for the expression of type information. This type information
can be used during <a>validation</a> processes as described in Appendix
<a href="#validation"></a>.
        </p>

        <p>
<a>Verifiable credentials</a> and <a>verifiable presentations</a> MUST have a
<code>type</code> <a>property</a>. That is, any <a>credential</a> or
<a>presentation</a> that does not have <code>type</code> <a>property</a>
<em>is not <a>verifiable</a></em>, so is neither a <a>verifiable credential</a>
nor a <a>verifiable presentation</a>.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><dfn data-lt="type|types">type</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
The value of the <code>type</code> <a>property</a> MUST be, or map to (through
interpretation of the <code>@context</code> property), one or more <a>URLs</a>.
If more than one <a>URL</a> is provided, the <a>URLs</a> MUST be interpreted
as an unordered set. Syntactic conveniences SHOULD be used to ease developer
usage. Such conveniences might include JSON-LD terms. It is RECOMMENDED that
each <a>URL</a> in the <code>type</code> be one which, if dereferenced, results
in a document containing machine-readable information about the
<code>type</code>.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <pre class="example nohighlight vc" title="Usage of the type property"

          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p class="note">
The <a>type</a> system for the Verifiable Credentials Data Model is the same as
for [[JSON-LD]] and is detailed in
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#specifying-the-type">Section 3.5:
Specifying the Type</a> and
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#json-ld-grammar">Section 9: JSON-LD
Grammar</a>. When using a JSON-LD context (see Section
<a href="#extensibility"></a>), this specification aliases the
<code>@type</code> keyword to <code>type</code> to make the JSON-LD documents
more easily understood. While application developers and document authors do
not need to understand the specifics of the JSON-LD type system, implementers
of this specification who want to support interoperable extensibility, do.
        </p>

        <p>
All <a>credentials</a>, <a>presentations</a>, and encapsulated objects MUST
specify, or be associated with, additional more narrow <a>types</a> (like
<code>UniversityDegreeCredential</code>, for example) so software systems can
process this additional information.
        </p>

        <p>
When processing encapsulated objects defined in this specification, (for
example, objects associated with the <code>credentialSubject</code> object or
deeply nested therein), software systems SHOULD use the <a>type</a> information
specified in encapsulating objects higher in the hierarchy. Specifically, an
encapsulating object, such as a <a>credential</a>, SHOULD convey the associated
object <a>types</a> so that <a>verifiers</a> can quickly determine the contents
of an associated object based on the encapsulating object <a>type</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
For example, a <a>credential</a> object with the <code>type</code> of
<code>UniversityDegreeCredential</code>, signals to a <a>verifier</a> that the
object associated with the <code>credentialSubject</code> property contains the
identifier for the:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
<a>Subject</a> in the <code>id</code> property.
          </li>
          <li>
Type of degree in the <code>type</code> property.
          </li>
          <li>
Title of the degree in the <code>name</code> property.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
This enables implementers to rely on values associated with the
<code>type</code> property for <a>verification</a> purposes. The expectation of
<a>types</a> and their associated properties should be documented in at least a
human-readable specification, and preferably, in an additional machine-readable
representation.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
The type system used in the data model described in this specification allows
for multiple ways to associate types with data. Implementers and authors are
urged to read the section on typing in the Verifiable Credentials
Implementation Guidelines [[?VC-IMP-GUIDE]].

      <section>
        <h3>Credential Subject</h3>

        <p>
A <a>verifiable credential</a> contains <a>claims</a> about one or more
<a>subjects</a>. This specification defines a <code>credentialSubject</code>
<a>property</a> for the expression of <a>claims</a> about one or more
<a>subjects</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
A <a>verifiable credential</a> MUST have a <code>credentialSubject</code>
<a>property</a>.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt>credentialSubject</dt>
          <dd>
The value of the <code>credentialSubject</code> <a>property</a> is defined as
a set of objects that MUST contain one or more claims that are each related to a
<a>subject</a> of the <a>verifiable credential</a>. Each object MAY contain an
<code>id</code>, as described in Section <a href="#identifiers"></a>.

        <h3>Issuer</h3>

        <p>
This specification defines a property for expressing the <a>issuer</a> of
a <a>verifiable credential</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
A <a>verifiable credential</a> MUST have an <code>issuer</code> <a>property</a>.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><var>issuer</var></dt>
          <dd>
The value of the <code>issuer</code> <a>property</a> MUST be either a
<a>URL</a> or an object containing an <code>id</code> <a>property</a>. It is
RECOMMENDED that the <a>URL</a> in the <code>issuer</code> or its
<code>id</code> be one which, if dereferenced, results in a document containing
machine-readable information about the <a>issuer</a> that can be used to
<a>verify</a> the information expressed in the <a>credential</a>.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <h3>Validity Period</h3>

        <p>
This specification defines the <code>validFrom</code> <a>property</a> to help an
issuer to express the date and time when a <a>credential</a> becomes valid and
the <code>validUntil</code> <a>property</a> for expressing the date and time
when a <a>credential</a> ceases to be valid.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><var>validFrom</var></dt>
          <dd>
A <a>credential</a> MUST have an <code>validFrom</code> <a>property</a>. The
value of the <code>validFrom</code> <a>property</a> MUST be a string value of
an [<a data-cite="XMLSCHEMA11-2#dateTime">XMLSCHEMA11-2</a>] combined
<code>date-time</code> string representing the date and time the
<a>credential</a> becomes valid, which could be a date and time in the future.
Note that this value represents the earliest point in time
at which the information associated with the <code>credentialSubject</code>
<a>property</a> becomes valid.
          </dd>
          <dt><var>validUntil</var></dt>
          <dd>
  If present, the value of the <code>validUntil</code> <a>property</a> MUST be
  a string value of an [<a data-cite="XMLSCHEMA11-2#dateTime">XMLSCHEMA11-2</a>]
  combined <code>date-time</code> string representing the date and time the
  <a>credential</a> ceases to be valid, which could be a date and time in the past.
  Note that this value represents the latest point in time at which the information

        <h3>Proofs (Signatures)</h3>

        <p>
At least one proof mechanism, and the details necessary to evaluate that proof,
MUST be expressed for a <a>credential</a> or <a>presentation</a> to be a
<a>verifiable credential</a> or <a>verifiable presentation</a>; that is, to be
<a>verifiable</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
This specification identifies two classes of proof mechanisms: external proofs
and embedded proofs. An <dfn class="lint-ignore">external proof</dfn> is one
that wraps an expression of this data model, such as a JSON Web Token, which is
elaborated on in the Securing Verifiable Credentials using JSON Web Tokens
[[?VC-JWT]] specification. An <dfn>embedded proof</dfn> is a mechanism where
the proof is included in the data, such as a Data Integrity Proof, which is
elaborated upon in Verifiable Credential Data Integrity [[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]].
        </p>

        <p>
When embedding a proof, the <code>proof</code> <a>property</a> MUST be used.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><var>proof</var></dt>
          <dd>
One or more cryptographic proofs that can be used to detect tampering and
verify the authorship of a <a>credential</a> or <a>presentation</a>. The
specific method used for an <a>embedded proof</a> MUST be included using the
<code>type</code> <a>property</a>.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
Because the method used for a mathematical proof varies by representation
language and the technology used, the set of name-value pairs that is expected
as the value of the <code>proof</code> <a>property</a> will vary accordingly.
For example, if digital signatures are used for the proof mechanism, the
<code>proof</code> <a>property</a> is expected to have name-value pairs that
include a signature, a reference to the signing entity, and a representation of
the signing date. The example below uses Ed25519 digital signatures.

  }</span>
}
        </pre>

        <p class="note">
As discussed in Section <a href="#conformance"></a>, there are multiple viable
proof mechanisms, and this specification does not standardize nor recommend any
single proof mechanism for use with <a>verifiable credentials</a>. For more
information about the <code>proof</code> mechanism, see the following
specifications: Data Integrity [[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]], Securing Verifiable
Credentials using JSON Web Tokens [VC-JWT], and the "Proofs" section of
the Verifiable Credential Specifications Directory [[VC-SPECS]].

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Status</h3>

        <p>
This specification defines the following <code>credentialStatus</code>
<a>property</a> for the discovery of information about the current status of a
<a>verifiable credential</a>, such as whether it is suspended or revoked.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><var>credentialStatus</var></dt>
          <dd>
If present, the value of the <code>credentialStatus</code> <a>property</a> MUST
include the following:

            <ul>
              <li>
<code>id</code> <a>property</a>, which MUST be a <a>URL</a> which MAY be
dereferenced.
              </li>
              <li>
<code>type</code> <a>property</a>, which expresses the <a>credential</a> status
type.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
The precise content of the <a>credential</a> status information is determined
by the specific <code>credentialStatus</code> <a>type</a> definition, and varies
depending on factors such as whether it is simple to implement or if it is
privacy-enhancing. It is expected that the value will provide enough information
to determine the current status of the <a>credential</a> and that machine
readable information will be retrievable from the URL. For example, the
object could contain a link to an external document which notes whether or not the
<a>credential</a> is suspended or revoked.

Defining the data model, formats, and protocols for status schemes are out of

for implementers who want to implement <a>verifiable credential</a>
status checking.

        <h3>Presentations</h3>

        <p>
<a>Presentations</a> MAY be used to combine and present <a>credentials</a>.
They can be packaged in such a way that the authorship of the data is
<a>verifiable</a>. The data in a <a>presentation</a> is often all about the same
<a>subject</a>, but there is no limit to the number of <a>subjects</a> or
<a>issuers</a> in the data. The aggregation of information from multiple
<a>verifiable credentials</a> is a typical use of
<a>verifiable presentations</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
A <a>verifiable presentation</a> is typically composed of the following
properties:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><var>id</var></dt>
          <dd>
The <code>id</code> <a>property</a> is optional and MAY be used to provide a
unique identifier for the <a>presentation</a>. For details related to the use of
this property, see Section <a href="#identifiers"></a>.
          </dd>
          <dt><var>type</var></dt>
          <dd>
The <code>type</code> <a>property</a> is required and expresses the
type of <a>presentation</a>, such as <code>VerifiablePresentation</code>. For
details related to the use of this property, see Section <a href="#types"></a>.
          </dd>
          <dt><var>verifiableCredential</var></dt>
          <dd>
If present, the value of the <code>verifiableCredential</code> <a>property</a>
MUST be constructed from one or more <a>verifiable credentials</a>, or of data
derived from <a>verifiable credentials</a> in a cryptographically
<a>verifiable</a> format.
          </dd>
          <dt><var>holder</var></dt>
          <dd>
If present, the value of the <code>holder</code> <a>property</a>
is expected to be a <a>URL</a> for the entity that is generating the
<a>presentation</a>.
          </dd>
          <dt><var>proof</var></dt>
          <dd>
If present, the value of the <code>proof</code> <a>property</a> ensures that
the <a>presentation</a> is <a>verifiable</a>. For details related to the use of
this property, see Section <a href="#proofs-signatures"></a>.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
The example below shows a <a>verifiable presentation</a> that embeds
<a>verifiable credentials</a>.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Basic structure of a presentation">

}
        </pre>

        <p>
The contents of the <code>verifiableCredential</code> <a>property</a> shown
above are <a>verifiable credentials</a>, as described by this specification. The
contents of the <code>proof</code> <a>property</a> are proofs, as described by
the Data Integrity [[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]] specification. An example of a
<a>verifiable presentation</a> using the JWT proof mechanism is
provided in the Securing Verifiable Credentials using JSON Web Tokens
[[?VC-JWT]] specification.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h4>Presentations Using Derived Credentials</h4>

          <p>
Some zero-knowledge cryptography schemes might enable <a>holders</a> to
indirectly prove they hold <a>claims</a> from a <a>verifiable credential</a>
without revealing the <a>verifiable credential</a> itself. In these schemes, a
<a>claim</a> from a <a>verifiable credential</a> might be used to derive a
presented value, which is cryptographically asserted such that a <a>verifier</a>
can trust the value if they trust the <a>issuer</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
For example, a <a>verifiable credential</a> containing the <a>claim</a>
<code>date of birth</code> might be used to derive the presented value
<code>over the age of 15</code> in a manner that is cryptographically
<a>verifiable</a>. That is, a <a>verifier</a> can still trust the derived value
if they trust the <a>issuer</a>.
          </p>

          <p class="note">
For an example of a ZKP-style <a>verifiable presentation</a> containing
derived data instead of directly embedded <a>verifiable credentials</a>, see
Section <a href="#zero-knowledge-proofs"></a>.
          </p>

          <p>
Selective disclosure schemes using zero-knowledge proofs can use <a>claims</a>
expressed in this model to prove additional statements about those <a>claims</a>.
For example, a <a>claim</a> specifying a <a>subject's</a> date of birth can be
used as a predicate to prove the <a>subject's</a> age is within a given range,
and therefore prove the <a>subject</a> qualifies for age-related discounts,
without actually revealing the <a>subject's</a> birthdate. The <a>holder</a>
has the flexibility to use the <a>claim</a> in any way that is applicable to
the desired <a>verifiable presentation</a>.

The roles and information flows in the <a>verifiable credential</a> ecosystem
are as follows:

          <li>
An <a>issuer</a> <dfn class="lint-ignore" data-lt="issue">issues</dfn> a

          <li>
A <a>verifier</a> <a>verifies</a> the authenticity of the presented

taking into account the <a>holder</a>, the <a>issuers</a> of the
<a>verifiable credentials</a>, the contents of the
<a>verifiable credentials</a>, and its own policies.

Whether the original <a>holder</a> passed a <a>verifiable credential</a> to a
subsequent <a>holder</a>.

Any restrictions using the <a>verifiable credentials</a> by the <a>holder</a>

        <h3>Trust Model</h3>

        <p>
The <a>verifiable credentials</a> trust model is as follows:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
The <a>verifier</a> trusts the <a>issuer</a> to issue the <a>credential</a> that
it received. To establish this trust, a <a>credential</a> is expected to either:
            <ul>
              <li>
Include a <a href="#proofs-signatures">proof</a> establishing that the
<a>issuer</a> generated the <a>credential</a> (that is, it is a
<a>verifiable credential</a>), or
              </li>
              <li>
Have been transmitted in a way clearly establishing that the <a>issuer</a>
generated the <a>verifiable credential</a> and that the
<a>verifiable credential</a> was not tampered with in transit or storage. This
trust could be weakened depending on the risk assessment of the <a>verifier</a>.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
All <a>entities</a> trust the <a>verifiable data registry</a> to be
tamper-evident and to be a correct record of which data is controlled by which
<a>entities</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
The <a>holder</a> and <a>verifier</a> trust the <a>issuer</a> to issue
true (that is, not false) <a>credentials</a> about the <a>subject</a>, and to
revoke them quickly when appropriate.
          </li>
          <li>
The <a>holder</a> trusts the <a>repository</a> to store <a>credentials</a>
securely, to not release them to anyone other than the <a>holder</a>, and to not
corrupt or lose them while they are in its care.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
This trust model differentiates itself from other trust models by ensuring
the:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
<a>Issuer</a> and the <a>verifier</a> do not need to trust the
<a>repository</a>
          </li>
          <li>
<a>Issuer</a> does not need to know or trust the <a>verifier</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
By decoupling the trust between the <a>identity provider</a> and the
<a>relying party</a> a more flexible and dynamic trust model is created such
that market competition and customer choice is increased.
        </p>

        <p>
For more information about how this trust model interacts with various threat
models studied by the Working Group, see the Verifiable Credentials Use Cases
document [[VC-USE-CASES]].
        </p>

        <p class="note">
The data model detailed in this specification does not imply a transitive trust
model, such as that provided by more traditional Certificate Authority trust
models. In the Verifiable Credentials Data Model, a <a>verifier</a> either
directly trusts or does not trust an <a>issuer</a>. While it is possible to
build transitive trust models using the Verifiable Credentials Data Model,
implementers are urged to
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-iab-web-pki-problems/">learn
about the security weaknesses</a> introduced by

      <section>
        <h3>Extensibility</h3>

        <p>
One of the goals of the Verifiable Credentials Data Model is to enable
permissionless innovation. To achieve this, the data model needs to be
extensible in a number of different ways. The data model is required to:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
Model complex multi-entity relationships through the use of a <a>graph</a>-based
data model.
          </li>
          <li>
Extend the machine-readable vocabularies used to describe information in the
data model, without the use of a centralized system for doing so, through the
use of [[?LINKED-DATA]].
          </li>
          <li>
Support multiple types of cryptographic proof formats through the use of
JSON Web Tokens [[VC-JWT]] and Data Integrity Proofs [[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]] and a variety of cryptographic
suites listed in the Verifiable Credential Specifications Directory
[[?VC-SPECS]].
          </li>
          <li>
Provide all of the extensibility mechanisms outlined above in a data format that
is popular with software developers and web page authors, and is enabled through
the use of [[JSON-LD]].
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
This approach to data modeling is often called an
<em>open world assumption</em>, meaning that any entity can say anything about
any other entity. While this approach seems to conflict with building simple and
predictable software systems, balancing extensibility with program correctness
is always more challenging with an open world assumption than with closed
software systems.
        </p>

        <p>
The rest of this section describes, through a series of examples, how both
extensibility and program correctness are achieved.
        </p>

        <p>
Let us assume we start with the <a>verifiable credential</a> shown below.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight vc"
          title="A simple credential"
          data-vc-vm="https://example.edu/issuers/14#keys-1">
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2"
  ],
  "id": "http://example.com/credentials/4643",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential"],
  "issuer": "https://example.com/issuers/14",
  "validFrom": "2018-02-24T05:28:04Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:abcdef1234567",
    "name": "Jane Doe"
  }
}
        </pre>

        <p>
This <a>verifiable credential</a> states that the <a>entity</a> associated with
<code>did:example:abcdef1234567</code> has a <code>name</code> with a value of
<code>Jane Doe</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
Now let us assume a developer wants to extend the <a>verifiable credential</a>
to store two additional pieces of information: an internal corporate reference
number, and Jane's favorite food.
        </p>

        <p>
The first thing to do is to create a JSON-LD context containing two new terms,
as shown below.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="A JSON-LD context">
{
  "@context": {
    "referenceNumber": "https://example.com/vocab#referenceNumber",
    "favoriteFood": "https://example.com/vocab#favoriteFood"
  }
}
        </pre>

        <p>
After this JSON-LD context is created, the developer publishes it somewhere so
it is accessible to <a>verifiers</a> who will be processing the
<a>verifiable credential</a>. Assuming the above JSON-LD context is published at
<code>https://example.com/contexts/mycontext.jsonld</code>, we can extend this
example by including the context and adding the new <a>properties</a> and
<a>credential</a> <a>type</a> to the <a>verifiable credential</a>.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight"
          title="A verifiable credential with a custom extension">
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2",
    <span class="highlight">"https://example.com/contexts/mycontext.jsonld"</span>
  ],
  "id": "http://example.com/credentials/4643",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "CustomExt12"],
  "issuer": "https://example.com/issuers/14",
  "validFrom": "2018-02-24T05:28:04Z",
  <span class="highlight">"referenceNumber": 83294847,</span>
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:abcdef1234567",
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    <span class="highlight">"favoriteFood": "Papaya"</span>
  }
}
        </pre>

        <p>
This example demonstrates extending the Verifiable Credentials Data Model in a
permissionless and decentralized way. The mechanism shown also ensures that
<a>verifiable credentials</a> created in this way provide a mechanism to prevent
namespace conflicts and semantic ambiguity.
        </p>

        <p>
A dynamic extensibility model such as this does increase the implementation
burden. Software written for such a system has to determine whether
<a>verifiable credentials</a> with extensions are acceptable based on the risk
profile of the application. Some applications might accept only certain
extensions while highly secure environments might not accept any extensions.
These decisions are up to the developers of these applications and are
specifically not the domain of this specification.
        </p>

        <p>
Developers are urged to ensure that extension JSON-LD contexts are highly
available. Implementations that cannot dereference a context will produce an
error. Strategies for ensuring that extension JSON-LD contexts are always
available include using content-addressed URLs for contexts, bundling context
documents with implementations, or enabling aggressive caching of contexts.
        </p>

        <p>
Implementers are advised to pay close attention to the extension points in this
specification, such as in Sections <a href="#proofs-signatures"></a>,
<a href="#status"></a>, <a href="#data-schemas"></a>,<a href="#refreshing"></a>,
<a href="#terms-of-use"></a>, and <a href="#evidence"></a>. While this
specification does not define concrete implementations for those extension
points, the Verifiable Credential Specifications Directory [[?VC-SPECS]]
provides an unofficial, curated list of extensions that developers can use from
these extension points.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h4>Semantic Interoperability</h4>

          <p>
This specification ensures that "plain" JSON and JSON-LD syntaxes are
semantically compatible without requiring JSON implementations to use a JSON-LD
processor. To achieve this, the specification imposes the following additional
requirements on both syntaxes:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
JSON-based processors MUST process the <code>@context</code> key, ensuring the
expected values exist in the expected order for the <a>credential</a> type being
processed. The order is important because keys used in a <a>credential</a>,
which are defined using the values associated with <code>@context</code>, are
defined using a "first defined wins" mechanism and changing the order might
result in a different key definition "winning".
            </li>
            <li>
JSON-LD-based processors MUST produce an error when a JSON-LD context redefines
any term in the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#dfn-active-context">active context</a>.
The only way to change the definition of existing terms is to introduce a new
term that clears the active context within the scope of that new term. Authors
that are interested in this feature should read about the
<code>@protected</code> feature in the JSON-LD 1.1 specification.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
A human-readable document describing the expected order of values for the
<code>@context</code> <a>property</a> is expected to be published by any
implementer seeking interoperability. A machine-readable description
(that is, a normal JSON-LD Context document) is expected to be published
at the URL specified in the <code>@context</code> <a>property</a> by
JSON-LD implementers seeking interoperability.
          </p>

          <p>
The requirements above guarantee semantic interoperability between JSON and
JSON-LD for terms defined by the <code>@context</code> mechanism. While JSON-LD
processors will use the specific mechanism provided and can verify that all
terms are correctly specified, JSON-based processors implicitly accept the same
set of terms without testing that they are correct. In other words, the context
in which the data exchange happens is explicitly stated for both JSON and
JSON-LD by using the same mechanism. With respect to JSON-based processors, this
is achieved in a lightweight manner, without having to use JSON-LD processing
libraries.

      <section>
        <h3>Data Schemas</h3>

        <p>
Data schemas are useful when enforcing a specific structure on a given
collection of data. There are at least two types of data schemas that this
specification considers:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
Data verification schemas, which are used to <a>verify</a> that the structure
and contents of a <a>credential</a> or <a>verifiable credential</a> conform to a
published schema.
          </li>
          <li>
Data encoding schemas, which are used to map the contents of a
<a>verifiable credential</a> to an alternative representation format, such as a
format used in a zero-knowledge proof.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
It is important to understand that data schemas serve a different purpose from
the <code>@context</code> property, which neither enforces data structure or
data syntax, nor enables the definition of arbitrary encodings to alternate
representation formats.
        </p>
        <p>
This specification defines the following <a>property</a> for the expression of a
data schema, which can be included by an <a>issuer</a> in
the <a>verifiable credentials</a> that it issues:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><var>credentialSchema</var></dt>
          <dd>
The value of the <code>credentialSchema</code> <a>property</a> MUST be one or
more data schemas that provide <a>verifiers</a> with enough information to
determine if the provided data conforms to the provided schema. Each
<code>credentialSchema</code> MUST specify its <code>type</code> (for example,
<code>CredentialSchema2022</code>), and an <code>id</code> <a>property</a>
that MUST be a <a>URL</a> identifying the schema file. The precise contents of
each data schema is determined by the specific type definition.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p class="note">
The <code>credentialSchema</code> <a>property</a> provides an opportunity to
annotate type definitions or lock them to specific versions of the vocabulary.
Authors of <a>verifiable credentials</a> can include a static version of their
vocabulary using <code>credentialSchema</code> that is locked to some content
integrity protection mechanism. The <code>credentialSchema</code>
<a>property</a> also makes it possible to perform syntactic checking on the
<a>credential</a> and to use <a>verification</a> mechanisms such as JSON Schema
[[?CREDENTIAL-SCHEMA-2022]] validation.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight"
          title="Usage of the credentialSchema property to perform JSON schema validation">

  }</span>
}
        </pre>

        <p>
In the example above, the <a>issuer</a> is specifying a
<code>credentialSchema</code>, which points to a [[?CREDENTIAL-SCHEMA-2022]] file that
can be used by a <a>verifier</a> to determine if the
<a>verifiable credential</a> is well formed.
        </p>

        <p class="note" >
For information about linkages to JSON Schema [[?CREDENTIAL-SCHEMA-2022]] or other
optional <a>verification</a> mechanisms, see the Verifiable Credentials
Implementation Guidelines [[VC-IMP-GUIDE]] document.
        </p>

        <p>
Data schemas can also be used to specify mappings to other formats, such as
those used to perform zero-knowledge proofs. For more information on using the
<code>credentialSchema</code> <a>property</a> with zero-knowledge proofs,
see Section <a href="#zero-knowledge-proofs"></a>.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Usage of the credentialSchema property to perform zero-knowledge validation">

}
        </pre>

        <p>
In the example above, the <a>issuer</a> is specifying a
<code>credentialSchema</code> pointing to a means of transforming the input
data into a format which can then be used by a <a>verifier</a> to determine if
the proof provided with the <a>verifiable credential</a> is valid.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Refreshing</h3>

        <p>
It is useful for systems to enable the manual or automatic refresh of an expired
<a>verifiable credential</a>. For more information about validity periods for
<a>verifiable credentials</a>, see Section <a href="#validity-periods"></a>.
This specification defines a <code>refreshService</code> <a>property</a>, which
enables an <a>issuer</a> to include a link to a refresh service.
        </p>
        <p>
The <a>issuer</a> can include the refresh service as an element inside the
<a>verifiable credential</a> if it is intended for either the <a>verifier</a> or
the <a>holder</a> (or both), or inside the <a>verifiable presentation</a> if it
is intended for the <a>holder</a> only. In the latter case, this enables the
<a>holder</a> to refresh the <a>verifiable credential</a> before creating a
<a>verifiable presentation</a> to share with a <a>verifier</a>. In the former
case, including the refresh service inside the <a>verifiable credential</a>
enables either the <a>holder</a> or the <a>verifier</a> to perform future
updates of the <a>credential</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
The refresh service is only expected to be used when either the
<a>credential</a> has expired or the <a>issuer</a> does not publish
<a>credential</a> status information. <a>Issuers</a> are advised not to put the
<code>refreshService</code> <a>property</a> in a <a>verifiable credential</a>
that does not contain public information or whose refresh service is not
protected in some way.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
Placing a <code>refreshService</code> <a>property</a> in a
<a>verifiable credential</a> so that it is available to <a>verifiers</a> can
remove control and consent from the <a>holder</a> and allow the
<a>verifiable credential</a> to be issued directly to the <a>verifier</a>,
thereby bypassing the <a>holder</a>.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><var>refreshService</var></dt>
          <dd>
The value of the <code>refreshService</code> <a>property</a> MUST be one or more
refresh services that provides enough information to the recipient's software
such that the recipient can refresh the <a>verifiable credential</a>. Each
<code>refreshService</code> value MUST specify its <code>type</code> (for
example, <code>ManualRefreshService2018</code>) and its <code>id</code>, which
is the <a>URL</a> of the service. There is an expectation that machine readable
information needs to be retrievable from the URL. The precise content of
each refresh service is determined by the specific <code>refreshService</code>
<a>type</a> definition.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <pre class="example nohighlight"
          title="Usage of the refreshService property by an issuer">

        <p>
In the example above, the <a>issuer</a> specifies a manual
<code>refreshService</code> that can be used by directing the <a>holder</a> or
the <a>verifier</a> to <code>https://example.edu/refresh/3732</code>.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Terms of Use</h3>

        <p>
Terms of use can be utilized by an <a>issuer</a> or a <a>holder</a> to
communicate the terms under which a <a>verifiable credential</a> or
<a>verifiable presentation</a> was issued. The <a>issuer</a> places their terms
of use inside the <a>verifiable credential</a>. The <a>holder</a> places their
terms of use inside a <a>verifiable presentation</a>. This specification defines
a <code>termsOfUse</code> <a>property</a> for expressing terms of use
information.
        </p>

        <p>
The value of the <code>termsOfUse</code> <a>property</a> tells the
<a>verifier</a> what actions it is required to perform (an <em>obligation</em>),
not allowed to perform (a <em>prohibition</em>), or allowed to perform (a
<em>permission</em>) if it is to accept the <a>verifiable credential</a> or
<a>verifiable presentation</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
Further study is required to determine how a <a>subject</a> who is not a
<a>holder</a> places terms of use on their <a>verifiable credentials</a>. One
way could be for the <a>subject</a> to request the <a>issuer</a> to place the
terms of use inside the issued <a>verifiable credentials</a>. Another way

        <h3>Evidence</h3>

        <p>
Evidence can be included by an <a>issuer</a> to provide the <a>verifier</a> with
additional supporting information in a <a>verifiable credential</a>. This could
be used by the <a>verifier</a> to establish the confidence with which it relies

For example, an <a>issuer</a> could check physical documentation provided by the
<a>subject</a> or perform a set of background checks before issuing the
<a>credential</a>. In certain scenarios, this information is useful to the
<a>verifier</a> when determining the risk associated with relying on a given
<a>credential</a>.

The value of the <code>evidence</code> <a>property</a> MUST be one or more
evidence schemes providing enough information for a <a>verifier</a> to determine
whether the evidence gathered by the <a>issuer</a> meets its confidence
requirements for relying on the <a>credential</a>. Each evidence scheme is
identified by its <a>type</a>. The <code>id</code> <a>property</a> is optional,
but if present, SHOULD contain a URL that points to where more information about
this instance of evidence can be found. The precise content of each evidence

        <h3>Zero-Knowledge Proofs</h3>

        <p class="issue" data-number="863">
We plan to remove the normative requirements in this section if there are no
active work items for securing <a>verifiable credentials</a> using zero
knowledge proof mechanisms when we transition v2 of the data model to CR.
Additionally, the remaining non-normative language will likely be moved to the
Verifiable Credentials Implementation Guidelines [[VC-IMP-GUIDE]].
        </p>
        <p>
Zero-knowledge proofs are cryptographic methods which enable a user to prove
knowledge of a value without disclosing the actual value. This data model
supports being secured with the use of zero-knowledge proof mechanisms.
        </p>
        <p>
Some capabilities that are compatible with <a>verifiable credentials</a> which
are made possible by zero-knowledge proof mechanisms:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
Selective disclosure of the properties in a <a>verifiable credential</a> by the
<a>holder</a> to a <a>verifier</a>. This allows a <a>holder</a> to provide a
<a>verifier</a> with precisely the information they need and nothing more.
This also enables the production of a derived <a>verifiable credential</a> that
is formatted according to the <a>verifier's</a> data schema without needing to
involve the <a>issuer</a> during presentation. This provides a great deal of
flexibility for <a>holders</a> to use their issued
<a>verifiable credentials</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
Blinding of the signature value that is shared with a <a>verifier</a>. Blinded
signatures allow for unlinkable proofs, which remove a common source of
<a>holder</a> correlation during multiple presentations to one or more
<a>verifiers</a>. This allows a <a>holder</a> to share a different signature
value with each presentation, which in turn reduces the amount of data shared.
          </li>
          <li>
Privacy preserving identification of the <a>holder</a> and/or <a>subject</a>. This
allows a <a>holder</a> to prove that a <a>credential</a> was issued to them, or
a <a>subject</a> to prove that a <a>credential</a> was issued about them,
without sharing an identifier. This also reduces the amount of data necessary to
be shared. This capability can also be used to combine multiple
<a>verifiable credentials</a> from multiple <a>issuers</a> into a single
<a>verifiable presentation</a> without revealing <a>verifiable credential</a> or
<a>subject</a> identifiers to the <a>verifier</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
Not all capabilities are supported in all zero-knowledge proof mechanisms.
Specific details about the capabilities and techniques provided by a particular
zero knowledge proof mechanism, along with any normative requirements for using
them with <a>verifiable credentials</a>, would be found in a specification for
securing <a>verifiable credentials</a> with that zero-knowledge proof mechanism.
        </p>
        <p>
We note that in most instances, for <a>holder</a> to make use of zero knowledge
mechanisms with <a>verifiable credentials</a> requires an <a>issuer</a> to
secure the <a>verifiable credential</a> in a manner that supports these
capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
There are two requirements for <a>verifiable credentials</a> when they are to be
used in zero-knowledge proof systems.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
The <a>verifiable credential</a> MUST contain a Proof, using the
<code>proof</code> <a>property</a>, so that the <a>holder</a> can derive a
<a>verifiable presentation</a> that reveals only the information that the
<a>holder</a> intends to reveal.
          </li>
          <li>
If a <a>credential</a> definition is being used, the <a>credential</a>
definition MUST be defined in the <code>credentialSchema</code> <a>property</a>,
so that it can be used by all parties to perform various cryptographic
operations in zero-knowledge.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
The examples below highlight how the data model might be used to issue and
present <a>verifiable credentials</a> in zero-knowledge.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
The provided examples will either be significantly re-written to demonstrate how
to secure a <a>verifiable credential</a> using a normatively defined method that
enable zero knowledge proofs, or they will be removed.
        </p>
        <p>
The following example shows one method of using <a>verifiable credentials</a> in
zero-knowledge. It makes use of a Camenisch-Lysyanskaya Signature
[[?CL-SIGNATURES]], which allows the presentation of the <a>verifiable
credential</a> in a way that supports the privacy of the
<a>holder</a> and <a>subject</a> through the use of selective disclosure of the
<a>verifiable credential</a> values. Some other cryptographic systems which rely
upon zero-knowledge proofs to selectively disclose attributes can be found in the
Verifiable Credential Specifications Directory [[?VC-SPECS]] as well.

The example above provides the <a>verifiable credential</a> definition by using
the <code>credentialSchema</code> <a>property</a> and a specific proof that is
usable in the Camenisch-Lysyanskaya Zero-Knowledge Proof system.

The next example utilizes the <a>verifiable credential</a> above to generate a

expected to be met:
        </p>

          <li>
Each derived <a>verifiable credential</a> within a <a>verifiable

          </li>
          <li>
The <a>verifiable presentation</a> SHOULD contain a <code>proof</code>
<a>property</a> to enable the <a>verifier</a> to check that all derived

      <h2>Syntaxes</h2>

      <p>
The data model as described in Sections
<a href="#core-data-model"></a>, <a href="#basic-concepts"></a>, and
<a href="#advanced-concepts"></a> is the canonical structural representation of
a <a>verifiable credential</a> or <a>verifiable presentation</a>. All
serializations are representations of that data model in a specific format. This
section specifies how the data model is realized in JSON-LD for
`application/vc+ld+json`, the base media type for Verifiable Credentials.
Although syntactic mappings are only provided for JSON-LD,
applications and services can use any other data representation syntax (such as
XML, YAML, or CBOR) that is capable of being mapped back to `application/vc+ld+json`.
As the <a>verification</a> and <a>validation</a> requirements are defined in terms
of the data model, all serialization syntaxes have to be deterministically
translated to the data model for processing, <a>validation</a>, or comparison.
      </p>

      <p>
The expected arity of the property values in this specification, and the
resulting datatype which holds those values, can vary depending on the property.
If present, the following properties are represented as a single value:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
<code>id</code> <a>property</a>
        </li>
        <li>
<code>issuer</code> <a>property</a>
        </li>
        <li>
<code>validFrom</code> <a>property</a>
        </li>
        <li>
<code>validUntil</code> <a>property</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
All other properties, if present, are represented as either a single value
or an array of values.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>JSON-LD</h3>

        <p>
[[!JSON-LD]] is a JSON-based format used to serialize
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ld-glossary/#linked-data">Linked Data</a>. The
syntax is designed to easily integrate into deployed systems already using JSON,
and provides a smooth upgrade path from JSON to [[!JSON-LD]]. It is primarily
intended to be a way to use Linked Data in Web-based programming environments,
to build interoperable Web services, and to store Linked Data in JSON-based
storage engines.
        </p>

        <p>
[[!JSON-LD]] is useful when extending the data model described in this
specification. Instances of the data model are encoded in JSON-LD compact
form [[!JSON-LD]] and include the <code>@context</code> <a>property</a>. The
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#the-context">JSON-LD context</a>
is described in detail in the [[!JSON-LD]] specification and its use is
elaborated on in Section <a href="#extensibility"></a>.
        </p>

        <p>
Multiple contexts MAY be used or combined to express any arbitrary information
about <a>verifiable credentials</a> in idiomatic JSON. The
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#the-context">JSON-LD context</a>,
available at <code>https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2</code>, is a static
document that is never updated and can therefore be downloaded and cached client
side. The associated vocabulary document for the Verifiable Credentials Data
Model is available at <code>https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
This specification restricts the usage of JSON-LD representations of
the data model. JSON-LD <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#compacted-document-form">compact document
form</a> MUST be utilized for all representations of the data model in the
base media type, `application/vc+ld+json`.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Syntactic Sugar</h3>

          <p>
In general, the data model and syntaxes described in this document are
designed such that developers can copy and paste examples to incorporate
<a>verifiable credentials</a> into their software systems. The design goal of
this approach is to provide a low barrier to entry while still ensuring global
interoperability between a heterogeneous set of software systems. This section
describes some of these approaches, which will likely go unnoticed by most
developers, but whose details will be of interest to implementers. The most
noteworthy syntactic sugars provided by [[!JSON-LD]] are:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
The <code>@id</code> and <code>@type</code> keywords are aliased to
<code>id</code> and <code>type</code> respectively, enabling developers to use
this specification as idiomatic JSON.
            </li>
            <li>
Data types, such as integers, dates, units of measure, and URLs, are
automatically typed to provide stronger type guarantees for use cases that
require them.
            </li>
            <li>
The <code>verifiableCredential</code> and <code>proof</code> <a>properties</a>
are treated as <em>graph containers</em>. That is, mechanisms used to isolate
sets of data asserted by different entities. This ensures, for example, proper
cryptographic separation between the data graph provided by each <a>issuer</a>
and the one provided by the <a>holder</a> presenting the
<a>verifiable credential</a> to ensure the provenance of the information for
each graph is preserved.
            </li>
            <li>
The <code>@protected</code> properties feature of [[!JSON-LD]] 1.1 is used to
ensure that terms defined by this specification cannot be overridden. This means
that as long as the same <code>@context</code> declaration is made at the top of
a <a>verifiable credential</a> or <a>verifiable presentation</a>,
interoperability is guaranteed for all terms understood by users of the data
model whether or not they use a [[!JSON-LD]] processor.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Media Types</h3>

        <p>
Media types, as defined in [[RFC6838]], identify the syntax used to express a
<a>verifiable credential</a> as well as other useful processing guidelines.
        </p>
        <p>
Syntaxes used to express the data model in this specification SHOULD be
identified by a media type, and conventions outlined in this section SHOULD be
followed when defining or using media types with <a>verifiable credentials</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
Any media types associated with the core data model are listed in the Section
<a href="#iana-considerations"></a>.
        </p>
        <p class="issue" data-number="1060">
The VCWG is currently discussing whether the presence of the term "verifiable"
(or a shortened version) in the media type may or may not imply a proof. The
Working Group is seeking implementation experience related to the use of media
types and the expectation related to whether or not a particular media type
is expected to be secure with a particular proof.
        </p>
        <p class="issue" data-number="1065">
The VCWG is currently debating whether all media types that start with
`application/vc+` indicate an expectation around the securing mechanism or not.
Working Group is seeking implementation experience related to the use of media
types and the expectation related to whether or not a particular media type
is expected to be secure with a particular proof.
        </p>
        <p>
There is one media type associated with the core data model:
`application/vc+ld+json`. Other specifications, such as [[?VC-JWT]],
define other media types that contain transformation rules that allow for
those other syntaxes to be transformed to the `application/vc+ld+json`
media type.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Proof Formats</h3>

        <p>
The data model described in this specification is designed to be proof format
agnostic. This specification does not normatively require any particular digital
proof or signature format. While the data model is the canonical representation
of a <a>credential</a> or <a>presentation</a>, the
proofing mechanisms for these are often tied to the syntax used in the
transmission of the document between parties. As such, each proofing mechanism
has to specify whether the verification of the proof is calculated against the
state of the document as transmitted, against the possibly transformed data model, or
against another form. At the time of publication, at least two proof formats
are being actively utilized by implementers and the Working Group felt
that documenting what these proof formats are and how they are being used would
be beneficial to implementers. The sections detailing the current proof formats
being actively utilized to issue <a>verifiable credentials</a> are:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
Verifiable Credentials using JSON Web Tokens [[VC-JWT]], and
          </li>
          <li>
Verifiable Credential Data Integrity [[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]].

      <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

      <p>
This section details the general privacy considerations and specific privacy
implications of deploying the Verifiable Credentials Data Model into production
environments.
      </p>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Spectrum of Privacy</h3>

        <p>
It is important to recognize there is a spectrum of privacy ranging from
pseudonymous to strongly identified. Depending on the use case, people have
different comfort levels about what information they are willing to provide
and what information can be derived from what is provided.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img style="margin: auto; display: block; width: 80%;"
            src="diagrams/privacy-spectrum.svg" alt="Horizontal bar with
            red on the left, orange in the middle, and green on the
            right.  The red has the text 'Highly correlatable (global
            IDs), e.g., government ID, shipping address, credit card
            number'.  The orange has the text 'Correlatable via collusion
            (personally identifiable info), e.g., name, birthday, zip
            code'.  The green has the text 'Non-correlatable
            (pseudonyms), e.g., age over 21'.">
          <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
Privacy spectrum ranging from pseudonymous to fully identified.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
For example, most people probably want to remain anonymous when purchasing
alcohol because the regulatory check required is solely based on whether a
person is above a specific age. Alternatively, for medical prescriptions
written by a doctor for a patient, the pharmacy fulfilling the prescription is
required to more strongly identify the medical professional and the patient.
Therefore there is not one approach to privacy that works for all use cases.
Privacy solutions are use case specific.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
Even for those wanting to remain anonymous when purchasing alcohol, photo
identification might still be required to provide appropriate assurance to the
merchant. The merchant might not need to know your name or other details (other
than that you are over a specific age), but in many cases just proof of age
might still be insufficient to meet regulations.
        </p>

        <p>
The Verifiable Credentials Data Model strives to support the full privacy
spectrum and does not take philosophical positions on the correct level of
anonymity for any specific transaction. The following sections provide guidance
for implementers who want to avoid specific scenarios that are hostile to
privacy.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>

        <p>
Data associated with <a>verifiable credentials</a> stored in the
<code>credential.credentialSubject</code> field is susceptible to privacy
violations when shared with <a>verifiers</a>. Personally identifying data, such
as a government-issued identifier, shipping address, and full name, can be
easily used to determine, track, and correlate an <a>entity</a>. Even
information that does not seem personally identifiable, such as the
combination of a birthdate and a postal code, has very powerful correlation
and de-anonymizing capabilities.
        </p>

        <p>
Implementers are strongly advised to warn <a>holders</a> when they share data
with these kinds of characteristics. <a>Issuers</a> are strongly advised to
provide privacy-protecting <a>verifiable credentials</a> when possible. For
example, issuing <code>ageOver</code> <a>verifiable credentials</a> instead of
date of birth <a>verifiable credentials</a> when a <a>verifier</a> wants to
determine if an <a>entity</a> is over the age of 18.
        </p>

        <p>
Because a <a>verifiable credential</a> often contains personally identifiable
information (PII), implementers are strongly advised to use mechanisms while
storing and transporting <a>verifiable credentials</a> that protect the data
from those who should not access it. Mechanisms that could be considered include
Transport Layer Security (TLS) or other means of encrypting the data while in
transit, as well as encryption or data access control mechanisms to protect
the data in a <a>verifiable credential</a> while at rest.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Identifier-Based Correlation</h3>

        <p>
<a>Subjects</a> of <a>verifiable credentials</a> are identified using the
<code>credential.credentialSubject.id</code> field. The identifiers used to
identify a <a>subject</a> create a greater risk of correlation when the
identifiers are long-lived or used across more than one web domain.
        </p>

        <p>
Similarly, disclosing the <a>credential</a> identifier
(<code>credential.id</code>) leads to situations where multiple
<a>verifiers</a>, or an <a>issuer</a> and a <a>verifier</a>, can collude to
correlate the <a>holder</a>. If <a>holders</a> want to reduce correlation, they
should use <a>verifiable credential</a> schemes that allow hiding the
identifier during <a>verifiable presentation</a>. Such schemes expect the
<a>holder</a> to generate the identifier and might even allow hiding the
identifier from the <a>issuer</a>, while still keeping the identifier embedded
and signed in the <a>verifiable credential</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
If strong anti-correlation properties are a requirement in a
<a>verifiable credentials</a> system, it is strongly advised that identifiers
are either:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
Bound to a single origin
          </li>
          <li>
Single-use
          </li>
          <li>
Not used at all, but instead replaced by short-lived, single-use bearer tokens.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Signature-Based Correlation</h3>

        <p>
The contents of <a>verifiable credentials</a> are secured using the
<code>credential.proof</code> field. The <a>properties</a> in this field
create a greater risk of correlation when the same values are used across more
than one session or domain and the value does not change. Examples include the
<code>verificationMethod</code>, <code>created</code>,
<code>proofPurpose</code>, and <code>jws</code> fields.
        </p>

        <p>
If strong anti-correlation properties are required, it is advised that
signature values and metadata are regenerated each time using technologies like
third-party pairwise signatures, zero-knowledge proofs, or group signatures.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
Even when using anti-correlation signatures, information might still be
contained in a <a>verifiable credential</a> that defeats the anti-correlation
properties of the cryptography used.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Long-Lived Identifier-Based Correlation</h3>

        <p>
<a>Verifiable credentials</a> might contain long-lived identifiers that could
be used to correlate individuals. These types of identifiers include
<a>subject</a> identifiers, email addresses, government-issued identifiers,
organization-issued identifiers, addresses, healthcare vitals,
<a>verifiable credential</a>-specific JSON-LD contexts, and many other sorts of
long-lived identifiers.
        </p>

        <p>
Organizations providing software to <a>holders</a> should strive to identify
fields in <a>verifiable credentials</a> containing information that could be
used to correlate individuals and warn <a>holders</a> when this information is
shared.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Device Fingerprinting</h3>

        <p>
There are mechanisms external to <a>verifiable credentials</a> that are used to
track and correlate individuals on the Internet and the Web. Some of these
mechanisms include Internet protocol (IP) address tracking, web browser
fingerprinting, evercookies, advertising network trackers, mobile network
position information, and in-application Global Positioning System (GPS) APIs.
Using <a>verifiable credentials</a> cannot prevent the use of these other
tracking technologies. Also, when these technologies are used in conjunction
with <a>verifiable credentials</a>, new correlatable information could be
discovered. For example, a birthday coupled with a GPS position can be used to
strongly correlate an individual across multiple websites.
        </p>

        <p>
It is recommended that privacy-respecting systems prevent the use of these
other tracking technologies when <a>verifiable credentials</a> are being used.
In some cases, tracking technologies might need to be disabled on devices that
transmit <a>verifiable credentials</a> on behalf of a <a>holder</a>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Favor Abstract Claims</h3>

        <p>
To enable recipients of <a>verifiable credentials</a> to use them in a variety
of circumstances without revealing more PII than necessary for transactions,
<a>issuers</a> should consider limiting the information published in a
<a>credential</a> to a minimal set needed for the expected purposes. One way to
avoid placing PII in a <a>credential</a> is to use an abstract <a>property</a>
that meets the needs of <a>verifiers</a> without providing specific information
about a <a>subject</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
For example, this document uses the <code>ageOver</code> <a>property</a>
instead of a specific birthdate, which constitutes much stronger PII. If
retailers in a specific market commonly require purchasers to be older than a
certain age, an <a>issuer</a> trusted in that market might choose to offer a
<a>verifiable credential</a> claiming that <a>subjects</a> have met that
requirement instead of offering <a>verifiable credentials</a> containing
<a>claims</a> about specific birthdates. This enables individual customers to
make purchases without revealing specific PII.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>The Principle of Data Minimization</h3>

        <p>
Privacy violations occur when information divulged in one context leaks into
another. Accepted best practice for preventing such violations is to limit the
information requested, and received, to the absolute minimum necessary. This
data minimization approach is required by regulation in multiple jurisdictions,
including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the
United States and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European
Union.
        </p>
        <p>
With <a>verifiable credentials</a>, data minimization for <a>issuers</a> means
limiting the content of a <a>verifiable credential</a> to the minimum required
by potential <a>verifiers</a> for expected use. For <a>verifiers</a>, data
minimization means limiting the scope of the information requested or
required for accessing services.
        </p>
        <p>
For example, a driver's license containing a driver's ID number, height, weight,
birthday, and home address is a <a>credential</a> containing more information
than is necessary to establish that the person is above a certain age.
        </p>

        <p>
It is considered best practice for <a>issuers</a> to atomize information or use
a signature scheme that allows for <a>selective disclosure</a>. For example, an
<a>issuer</a> of driver's licenses could issue a <a>verifiable credential</a>
containing every attribute that appears on a driver's license, as well as a set
of <a>verifiable credentials</a> where every <a>verifiable credential</a>
contains only a single attribute, such as a person's birthday. It could also
issue more abstract <a>verifiable credentials</a> (for example, a
<a>verifiable credential</a> containing only an <code>ageOver</code> attribute).
One possible adaptation would be for <a>issuers</a> to provide secure HTTP
endpoints for retrieving single-use <a>bearer credentials</a> that promote the
pseudonymous usage of <a>verifiable credentials</a>. Implementers that find this
impractical or unsafe, should consider using <a>selective disclosure</a> schemes
that eliminate dependence on <a>issuers</a> at proving time and reduce temporal
correlation risk from <a>issuers</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
<a>Verifiers</a> are urged to only request information that is absolutely
necessary for a specific transaction to occur. This is important for at least
two reasons. It:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
Reduces the liability on the <a>verifier</a> for handling highly sensitive
information that it does not need to.
          </li>
          <li>
Enhances the privacy of the individual by only asking for information required
for a specific transaction.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="note">
While it is possible to practice the principle of minimum disclosure, it might
be impossible to avoid the strong identification of an individual for
specific use cases during a single session or over multiple sessions. The
authors of this document cannot stress how difficult it is to meet this
principle in real-world scenarios.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Bearer Credentials</h3>

        <p>
A <dfn data-lt="bearer credentials">bearer credential</dfn> is a
privacy-enhancing piece of information, such as a concert ticket, which entitles
the <a>holder</a> of the bearer credential to a specific resource without
divulging sensitive information about the <a>holder</a>. Bearer credentials are
often used in low-risk use cases where the sharing of the bearer credential is
not a concern or would not result in large economic or reputational losses.
        </p>

        <p>
<a>Verifiable credentials</a> that are <a>bearer credentials</a> are made
possible by not specifying the <a>subject</a> identifier, expressed using the
<code>id</code> <a>property</a>, which is nested in the
<code>credentialSubject</code> <a>property</a>. For example, the following
<a>verifiable credential</a> is a <a>bearer credential</a>:

        <p>
While <a>bearer credentials</a> can be privacy-enhancing, they must be carefully
crafted so as not accidentally divulge more information than the <a>holder</a>
of the <a>bearer credential</a> expects. For example, repeated use of the same
<a>bearer credential</a> across multiple sites enables these sites to
potentially collude to unduly track or correlate the <a>holder</a>. Likewise,
information that might seem non-identifying, such as a birthdate and postal
code, can be used to statistically identify an individual when used together in
the same <a>bearer credential</a> or session.
        </p>

        <p>
<a>Issuers</a> of <a>bearer credentials</a> should ensure that the
<a>bearer credentials</a> provide privacy-enhancing benefits that:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
Are single-use, where possible.
          </li>
          <li>
Do not contain personally identifying information.
          </li>
          <li>
Are not unduly correlatable.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
<a>Holders</a> should be warned by their software if <a>bearer credentials</a>
containing sensitive information are issued or requested, or if there is a
correlation risk when combining two or more <a>bearer credentials</a> across one
or more sessions. While it might be impossible to detect all correlation risks,
some might certainly be detectable.
        </p>

        <p>
<a>Verifiers</a> should not request <a>bearer credentials</a> that can be used
to unduly correlate the <a>holder</a>.

        <h3>Validity Checks</h3>

        <p>
When processing <a>verifiable credentials</a>, <a>verifiers</a> are expected to
perform many of the checks listed in Appendix <a href="#validation"></a> as
well as a variety of specific business process checks. Validity checks might
include checking:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
The professional licensure status of the <a>holder</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
A date of license renewal or revocation.
          </li>
          <li>
The sub-qualifications of an individual.
          </li>
          <li>
If a relationship exists between the <a>holder</a> and the <a>entity</a>
with whom the <a>holder</a> is attempting to interact.
          </li>
          <li>
The geolocation information associated with the <a>holder</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
The process of performing these checks might result in information leakage that
leads to a privacy violation of the <a>holder</a>. For example, a simple
operation such as checking a revocation list can notify the <a>issuer</a> that a
specific business is likely interacting with the <a>holder</a>. This could
enable <a>issuers</a> to collude and correlate individuals without their
knowledge.
        </p>

        <p>
<a>Issuers</a> are urged to not use mechanisms, such as <a>credential</a>
revocation lists that are unique per <a>credential</a>, during the
<a>verification</a> process that could lead to privacy violations. Organizations
providing software to <a>holders</a> should warn when <a>credentials</a> include
information that could lead to privacy violations during the verification
process. <a>Verifiers</a> should consider rejecting <a>credentials</a> that
produce privacy violations or that enable bad privacy practices.
        </p>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Storage Providers and Data Mining</h3>

        <p>
When a <a>holder</a> receives a <a>verifiable credential</a> from an
<a>issuer</a>, the <a>verifiable credential</a> needs to be stored somewhere
(for example, in a <a>credential</a> repository). <a>Holders</a> are warned that
the information in a <a>verifiable credential</a> is sensitive in nature and
highly individualized, making it a high value target for data mining. Services
that advertise free storage of <a>verifiable credentials</a> might in fact be
mining personal data and selling it to organizations wanting to build
individualized profiles on people and organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
<a>Holders</a> need to be aware of the terms of service for their
<a>credential</a> repository, specifically the correlation and data mining
protections in place for those who store their <a>verifiable credentials</a>
with the service provider.
        </p>
        <p>
Some effective mitigations for data mining and profiling include using:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
Service providers that do not sell your information to third parties.
          </li>
          <li>
Software that encrypts <a>verifiable credentials</a> such that a service
provider cannot view the contents of the <a>credential</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
Software that stores <a>verifiable credentials</a> locally on a device that you
control and that does not upload or analyze your information beyond your
expectations.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Aggregation of Credentials</h3>

        <p>
Holding two pieces of information about the same <a>subject</a> almost always
reveals more about the <a>subject</a> than just the sum of the two pieces, even
when the information is delivered through different channels. The aggregation of
<a>verifiable credentials</a> is a privacy risk and all participants in
the ecosystem need to be aware of the risks of data aggregation.
        </p>

        <p>
For example, if two <a>bearer credentials</a>, one for an email address and then
one stating the <a>holder</a> is over the age of 21, are provided across
multiple sessions, the <a>verifier</a> of the information now has a unique
identifier as well as age-related information for that individual. It is now
easy to create and build a profile for the <a>holder</a> such that more and more
information is leaked over time. Aggregation of <a>credentials</a> can also be
performed across multiple sites in collusion with each other, leading to privacy
violations.
        </p>

        <p>
From a technological perspective, preventing aggregation of information is a
very difficult privacy problem to address. While new cryptographic techniques,
such as zero-knowledge proofs, are being proposed as solutions to the problem
of aggregation and correlation, the existence of long-lived identifiers and
browser tracking techniques defeats even the most modern cryptographic
techniques.
        </p>

        <p>
The solution to the privacy implications of correlation or aggregation tends not
to be technological in nature, but policy driven instead. Therefore, if a
<a>holder</a> does not want information about them to be aggregated, they must
express this in the <a>verifiable presentations</a> they transmit.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Usage Patterns</h3>

        <p>
Despite the best efforts to assure privacy, actually using
<a>verifiable credentials</a> can potentially lead to de-anonymization and a
loss of privacy. This correlation can occur when:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
The same <a>verifiable credential</a> is presented to the same <a>verifier</a>
more than once. The <a>verifier</a> could infer that the <a>holder</a> is the
same individual.
          </li>
          <li>
The same <a>verifiable credential</a> is presented to different
<a>verifiers</a>, and either those <a>verifiers</a> collude or a third party
has access to transaction records from both <a>verifiers</a>. An observant
party could infer that the individual presenting the
<a>verifiable credential</a> is the same person at both services. That is, the
accounts are controlled by the same person.
          </li>
          <li>
A <a>subject</a> identifier of a <a>credential</a> refers to the same
<a>subject</a> across multiple <a>presentations</a> or <a>verifiers</a>. Even
when different <a>credentials</a> are presented, if the <a>subject</a>
identifier is the same, <a>verifiers</a> (and those with access to
<a>verifier</a> logs) could infer that the <a>holder</a> of the
<a>credential</a> is the same person.
          </li>
          <li>
The underlying information in a <a>credential</a> can be used to identify an
individual across services. In this case, using information from other sources
(including information provided directly by the <a>holder</a>), <a>verifiers</a>
can use information inside the <a>credential</a> to correlate the individual
with an existing profile. For example, if a <a>holder</a> presents
<a>credentials</a> that include postal code, age, and gender, a <a>verifier</a>
can potentially correlate the <a>subject</a> of that <a>credential</a> with an
established profile. For more information, see [[DEMOGRAPHICS]].
          </li>
          <li>
Passing the identifier of a <a>credential</a> to a centralized revocation
server. The centralized server can correlate the <a>credential</a> usage across
interactions. For example, if a <a>credential</a> is used for proof of age in
this manner, the centralized service could know everywhere that
<a>credential</a> was presented (all liquor stores, bars, adult stores, lottery
purchases, and so on).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
In part, it is possible to mitigate this de-anonymization and loss of privacy
by:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
Using a globally-unique identifier as the <a>subject</a> for any given
<a>credential</a> and never re-use that <a>credential</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
If the <a>credential</a> supports revocation, using a globally-distributed
service for revocation.
          </li>
          <li>
Designing revocation APIs that do not depend on submitting the ID of the
<a>credential</a>. For example, use a revocation list instead of a query.
          </li>
          <li>
Avoiding the association of personally identifiable information with any
specific long-lived <a>subject</a> identifier.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
It is understood that these mitigation techniques are not always practical
or even compatible with necessary usage. Sometimes correlation is a
requirement.
        </p>
        <p>
For example, in some prescription drug monitoring programs, usage monitoring is
a requirement. Enforcement entities need to be able to confirm that individuals
are not cheating the system to get multiple prescriptions for controlled
substances. This statutory or regulatory need to correlate usage overrides
individual privacy concerns.
        </p>

        <p>
<a>Verifiable credentials</a> will also be used to intentionally correlate
individuals across services, for example, when using a common persona to log in
to multiple services, so all activity on each of those services is
intentionally linked to the same individual. This is not a privacy issue as
long as each of those services uses the correlation in the expected manner.
        </p>

        <p>
Privacy risks of <a>credential</a> usage occur when unintended or unexpected
correlation arises from the presentation of <a>credentials</a>.

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Sharing Information with the Wrong Party</h3>

        <p>
When a <a>holder</a> chooses to share information with a <a>verifier</a>, it
might be the case that the <a>verifier</a> is acting in bad faith and requests
information that could be used to harm the <a>holder</a>. For example, a
<a>verifier</a> might ask for a bank account number, which could then be used
with other information to defraud the <a>holder</a> or the bank.
        </p>

        <p>
<a>Issuers</a> should strive to tokenize as much information as possible such
that if a <a>holder</a> accidentally transmits <a>credentials</a> to the wrong
<a>verifier</a>, the situation is not catastrophic.
        </p>

        <p>
For example, instead of including a bank account number for the purpose of
checking an individual's bank balance, provide a token that enables the
<a>verifier</a> to check if the balance is above a certain amount. In this
case, the bank could issue a <a>verifiable credential</a> containing a balance
checking token to a <a>holder</a>. The <a>holder</a> would then include the
<a>verifiable credential</a> in a <a>verifiable presentation</a> and bind the
token to a credit checking agency using a digital signature. The
<a>verifier</a> could then wrap the <a>verifiable presentation</a> in their
digital signature, and hand it back to the issuer to dynamically check the
account balance.
        </p>

        <p>
Using this approach, even if a <a>holder</a> shares the account balance token
with the wrong party, an attacker cannot discover the bank account number, nor
the exact value in the account. And given the validity period for the
counter-signature, does not gain access to the token for more than a few
minutes.
        </p>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Frequency of Claim Issuance</h3>

        <p>
As detailed in Section <a href="#usage-patterns"></a>, usage patterns can be
correlated into certain types of behavior. Part of this correlation is
mitigated when a <a>holder</a> uses a <a>verifiable credential</a> without the
knowledge of the <a>issuer</a>. <a>Issuers</a> can defeat this protection
however, by making their <a>verifiable credentials</a> short lived and renewal
automatic.
        </p>

        <p>
For example, an <code>ageOver</code> <a>verifiable credential</a> is useful for
gaining access to a bar. If an <a>issuer</a> issues such a
<a>verifiable credential</a> with a very short validity period and an automatic
renewal mechanism, then the <a>issuer</a> could possibly correlate the behavior
of the <a>holder</a> in a way that negatively impacts the <a>holder</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
Organizations providing software to <a>holders</a> should warn them if they
repeatedly use <a>credentials</a> with short lifespans, which could result in
behavior correlation. <a>Issuers</a> should avoid issuing <a>credentials</a> in
a way that enables them to correlate usage patterns.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Prefer Single-Use Credentials</h3>

        <p>
An ideal privacy-respecting system would require only the information necessary
for interaction with the <a>verifier</a> to be disclosed by the <a>holder</a>.
The <a>verifier</a> would then record that the disclosure requirement was met
and forget any sensitive information that was disclosed. In many cases,
competing priorities, such as regulatory burden, prevent this ideal system from
being employed. In other cases, long-lived identifiers prevent single use. The
design of any <a>verifiable credentials</a> ecosystem, however, should strive
to be as privacy-respecting as possible by preferring single-use
<a>verifiable credentials</a> whenever possible.
        </p>

        <p>
Using single-use <a>verifiable credentials</a> provides several benefits. The
first benefit is to <a>verifiers</a> who can be sure that the data in a
<a>verifiable credential</a> is fresh. The second benefit is to <a>holders</a>,
who know that if there are no long-lived identifiers in the
<a>verifiable credential</a>, the <a>verifiable credential</a> itself cannot be
used to track or correlate them online. Finally, there is nothing for attackers
to steal, making the entire ecosystem safer to operate within.

        <h3>Private Browsing</h3>

        <p>
In an ideal private browsing scenario, no PII will be revealed. Because many
<a>credentials</a> include PII, organizations providing software to
<a>holders</a> should warn them about the possibility of revealing this
information if they wish to use <a>credentials</a> and <a>presentations</a>
while in private browsing mode. As each browser vendor handles private browsing
differently, and some browsers might not have this feature at all, it is
important for implementers to be aware of these differences and implement
solutions accordingly.

      </section>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Issuer Cooperation Impacts on Privacy</h3>

        <p>
It cannot be overstated that <a>verifiable credentials</a> rely on a high
degree of trust in <a>issuers</a>. The degree to which a <a>holder</a> might take
advantage of possible privacy protections often depends strongly on the support
an <a>issuer</a> provides for such features. In many cases, privacy protections
which make use of zero-knowledge proofs, data minimization techniques, bearer
credentials, abstract claims, and protections against signature-based
correlation, require the <a>issuer</a> to actively support such capabilities and
incorporate them into the <a>verifiable credentials</a> they issue.
        </p>
        <p>
It should also be noted that, in addition to a reliance on <a>issuer</a>
participation to provide <a>verifiable credential</a> capabilities that help
preserve <a>holder</a> and <a>subject</a> privacy, <a>holders</a> rely on
<a>issuers</a> to not deliberately subvert privacy protections. For example, an
<a>issuer</a> might sign <a>verifiable credentials</a> using a signature scheme
that protects against signature-based correlation. This would protect the
<a>holder</a> from being correlated by the signature value as it is shared among
<a>verifiers</a>. However, if the <a>issuer</a> creates a unique key for each
issued <a>credential</a>, it might be possible for the <a>issuer</a> to track
<a>presentations</a> of the <a>credential</a>, regardless of a <a>verifier</a>'s
inability to do so.

      <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

      <p>
There are a number of security considerations that <a>issuers</a>,
<a>holders</a>, and <a>verifiers</a> should be aware of when processing data
described by this specification. Ignoring or not understanding the implications
of this section can result in security vulnerabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
While this section attempts to highlight a broad set of security considerations,
it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged to seek the advice of security
and cryptography professionals when implementing mission critical systems using
the technology outlined in this specification.
      </p>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Cryptography Suites and Libraries</h3>

        <p>
Some aspects of the data model described in this specification can be
protected through the use of cryptography. It is important for implementers to
understand the cryptography suites and libraries used to create and process
<a>credentials</a> and <a>presentations</a>. Implementing and auditing
cryptography systems generally requires substantial experience. Effective
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team">red teaming</a> can also
help remove bias from security reviews.
        </p>

        <p>
Cryptography suites and libraries have a shelf life and eventually fall to
new attacks and technology advances. Production quality systems need to take
this into account and ensure mechanisms exist to easily and proactively upgrade
expired or broken cryptography suites and libraries, and to invalidate
and replace existing <a>credentials</a>. Regular monitoring is important to
ensure the long term viability of systems processing <a>credentials</a>.

        <h3>Content Integrity Protection</h3>

        <p>
<a>Verifiable credentials</a> often contain URLs to data that resides outside of
the <a>verifiable credential</a> itself. Linked content that exists outside a
<a>verifiable credential</a>, such as images, JSON-LD Contexts, and other
machine-readable data, are often not protected against tampering because the

such schemes are the [[HASHLINK]] specification and the [[IPFS]]. The example

the JSON-LD Contexts using the [[HASHLINK]] specification, and content integrity

For example, a university might issue two <a>verifiable credentials</a> to a
person, each containing two <a>properties</a>, which must be taken together to
to designate the "role" of that person in a given "department", such as "Staff
Member" in the "Department of Computing", or "Post Graduate Student" in the
"Department of Economics". If these <a>verifiable credentials</a> are atomized
to put only one of these <a>properties</a> into each <a>credential</a> , then
the university would issue four <a>credentials</a> to the person, each
containing one of the following designations: "Staff Member", "Post Graduate
Student", "Department of Computing", and "Department of Economics". The
<a>holder</a> might then transfer the "Staff Member" and "Department of
Economics" <a>verifiable credentials</a> to a <a>verifier</a>, which together
would comprise a false <a>claim</a>.

        <h3>Highly Dynamic Information</h3>

        <p>
When <a>verifiable credentials</a> are issued for highly dynamic information,
implementers should ensure the validity periods are set appropriately. Validity
periods longer than the timeframe where the <a>verifiable credential</a> is
meant for use might create exploitable security vulnerabilities. Validity
periods shorter than the timeframe where the information expressed by the
<a>verifiable credential</a> is expected to be used creates a burden on
<a>holders</a> and <a>verifiers</a>. It is therefore important to set validity
periods for <a>verifiable credentials</a> that are appropriate to the use case
and the expected lifetime for the information contained in the
<a>verifiable credential</a>.

        <p>
When <a>verifiable credentials</a> are stored on a device and that

to systems using the victim's <a>verifiable credentials</a>. Ways to mitigate
this type of attack include:

Enabling password, pin, pattern, or biometric screen unlock protection on the

      <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>

      <p>
There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers should be
aware of when processing data described in this specification. As with
implementation of any web standard or protocol, ignoring accessibility issues
makes this information unusable by a large subset of the population. It is
important to follow accessibility guidelines and standards, such as [[WCAG21]],
to ensure that all people, regardless of ability, can make use of this data.
This is especially important when establishing systems utilizing cryptography,
which have historically created problems for assistive technologies.
      </p>

      <p>
This section details the general accessibility considerations to take into
account when utilizing this data model.
      </p>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Data First Approaches</h3>

        <p>
Many physical <a>credentials</a> in use today, such as government identification
cards, have poor accessibility characteristics, including, but not limited to,
small print, reliance on small and high-resolution images, and no affordances
for people with vision impairments.
        </p>

        <p>
When utilizing this data model to create <a>verifiable credentials</a>, it is
suggested that data model designers use a <em>data first</em> approach. For
example, given the choice of using data or a graphical image to depict a
<a>credential</a>, designers should express every element of the image, such as
the name of an institution or the professional <a>credential</a>, in a
machine-readable way instead of relying on a viewer's interpretation of the
image to convey this information. Using a data first approach is preferred
because it provides the foundational elements of building different interfaces
for people with varying abilities.

      <h2>Internationalization Considerations</h2>

      <p>
Implementers are advised to be aware of a number of internationalization
considerations when publishing data described in this specification.
As with any web standards or protocols implementation, ignoring
internationalization makes it difficult for data to be produced and consumed
across a disparate set of languages and societies, which limits the
applicability of the specification and significantly diminishes its value as a
standard.
      </p>

      <p>
Implementers are strongly advised to read the
<em>Strings on the Web: Language and Direction Metadata</em> document
[[STRING-META]], published by the W3C Internationalization Activity, which
elaborates on the need to provide reliable metadata about text to support
internationalization. For the latest information on internationalization
considerations, implementers are also urged to read the Verifiable Credentials
Implementation Guidelines [[VC-IMP-GUIDE]] document.
      </p>

      <p>
This section outlines general internationalization considerations to take into
account when utilizing this data model and is intended to highlight specific
parts of the <em>Strings on the Web: Language and Direction Metadata</em>
document [[STRING-META]] that implementers might be interested in reading.
      </p>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Language and Base Direction</h3>

        <p>
Data publishers are strongly encouraged to read the section on
Cross-Syntax Expression in the <em>Strings on the Web: Language and Direction
Metadata</em> document [[STRING-META]] to ensure that the expression of
language and base direction information is possible across multiple expression
syntaxes, such as [[JSON-LD]], [[JSON]], and CBOR [[?RFC7049]].
        </p>

        <p>
The general design pattern is to use the following markup template when
expressing a text string that is tagged with a language and, optionally, a
specific base direction.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Design pattern for natural language strings">
"<a>property</a>": {
  "value": "<span class="highlight">The string value</span>",
  "lang": "<code>LANGUAGE</code>"
  "dir": "<code>DIRECTION</code>"
}
        </pre>

        <p>
Using the design pattern above, the following example expresses the title of a
book in the English language without specifying a text direction.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Expressing natural language text as English">
"title": {
  "value": "<span class="highlight">HTML and CSS: Designing and Creating Websites</span>",
  "lang": "<code>en</code>"
}
        </pre>

        <p>
The next example uses a similar title expressed in the Arabic language with a
base direction of right-to-left.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Arabic text with a base direction of right-to-left">
"title": {
  "value": "<span class="highlight">HTML و CSS: تصميم و إنشاء مواقع الويب</span>",
  "lang": "<code>ar</code>"
  "dir": "<code>rtl</code>"
}
        </pre>

        <p class="note">
The text above would most likely be rendered incorrectly as left-to-right
without the explicit expression of language and direction because many systems
use the first character of a text string to determine text direction.
        </p>

        <p>
Implementers utilizing JSON-LD are strongly urged to
<a href="#extensibility">extend</a> the JSON-LD Context defining the
internationalized <a>property</a> and use the Scoped Context feature of JSON-LD
to alias the <code>@value</code>, <code>@language</code>, and
<code>@direction</code> keywords to <code>value</code>, <code>lang</code>,
and <code>dir</code>, respectively. An example of a JSON-LD Context snippet
doing this is shown below.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Specifying scoped aliasing for language information">
"title": {
  <span class="highlight">"@context": {"value": "@value", "lang": "@language", "dir": "@direction"}</span>,

        <h3>Complex Language Markup</h3>

        <p>
When multiple languages, base directions, and annotations are used in a single
natural language string, more complex mechanisms are typically required. It is
possible to use markup languages, such as HTML, to encode text with multiple
languages and base directions. It is also possible to use the
<code>rdf:HTML</code> datatype to encode such values accurately in JSON-LD.
        </p>

        <p>
Despite the ability to encode information as HTML, implementers are strongly
discouraged from doing this because it:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
Requires some version of an HTML processor, which increases the burden of
processing language and base direction information.
          </li>
          <li>
Increases the security attack surface when utilizing this data model because
blindly processing HTML could result in executing a <code>script</code> tag that
an attacker injected at some point during the data production process.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
If implementers feel they must use HTML, or other markup languages capable of
containing executable scripts, to address a specific use case, they are advised
to analyze how an attacker would use the markup to mount injection attacks
against a consumer of the markup and then deploy mitigations against the
identified attacks.

While this specification does not provide conformance criteria for the process

information in this data model is expected to be utilized by <a>verifiers</a>

        <h3>Credential Type</h3>

        <p>
When a <a>verifier</a> requests one or more <a>verifiable credentials</a>
from a <a>holder</a>, they can specify the type of credential(s) that they would
like to receive. The type of a credential is expressed via the
<a href="#types">type</a> property. A <a>verifiable credential</a> of a specific
type is expected to contain specific <a>properties</a> that can be used to
determine whether or not the <a>presentation</a> meets a set of processing rules
that the <a>verifier</a> is executing. By requesting
<a>verifiable credentials</a> of a particular <code>type</code>, the
<a>verifier</a> is able to gather specific information from the <a>holder</a>,
which originated  with the <a>issuer</a> of each <a>verifiable credential</a>,
that will enable it to determine the next stage of an interaction with a
<a>holder</a>.

        <h3>Credential Subject</h3>

        <p>
In the <a>verifiable credentials</a> presented by a <a>holder</a>, the value
associated with the <code>id</code> <a>property</a> for each
<code>credentialSubject</code> is expected to identify a <a>subject</a> to the
<a>verifier</a>. If the <a>holder</a> is also the <a>subject</a>, then
the <a>verifier</a> could authenticate the <a>holder</a> if they have
public key metadata related to the <a>holder</a>. The <a>verifier</a> could then
authenticate the <a>holder</a> using a signature generated by the <a>holder</a>
contained in the <a>verifiable presentation</a>. The <code>id</code>
<a>property</a> is optional. <a>Verifiers</a> could use other <a>properties</a>

        <p>
The value associated with the <code>issuer</code> <a>property</a> is expected
to identify an <a>issuer</a> that is known to and trusted by the
<a>verifier</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
Relevant metadata about the <code>issuer</code> <a>property</a> is expected
to be available to the <a>verifier</a>. For example, an <a>issuer</a> can
publish information containing the public keys it uses to digitally sign
<a>verifiable credentials</a> that it issued. This metadata is relevant when

      </section>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Proofs (Signatures)</h3>

        <p>
The cryptographic mechanism used to prove that the information in a
<a>verifiable credential</a> or <a>verifiable presentation</a> was not
tampered with is called a <em>proof</em>. There are many types of cryptographic
proofs including, but not limited to, digital signatures, zero-knowledge proofs,
Proofs of Work, and Proofs of Stake. In general, when verifying proofs,
implementations are expected to ensure:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
The proof is available in the form of a known proof suite.
          </li>
          <li>
All required proof suite <a>properties</a> are present.
          </li>
          <li>
The proof suite <a>verification</a> algorithm, when applied to the data, results
in an acceptable proof.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
Some proofs are digital signatures. In general, when verifying digital
signatures, implementations are expected to ensure:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
Acceptably recent metadata regarding the public key associated with the
signature is available. For example, the metadata might include
<a>properties</a> related to validity periods, key owner, or key purpose.
          </li>
          <li>
The key is not suspended, revoked, or expired.
          </li>
          <li>
The cryptographic signature is expected to verify.
          </li>
          <li>
If the cryptographic suite expects a <code>proofPurpose</code> <a>property</a>,
it is expected to exist and be a valid value, such as
<code>assertionMethod</code>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="note">
The digital signature provides a number of protections, other than tamper
resistance, which are not immediately obvious. For example, a Linked Data
Signature <code>created</code> <a>property</a> establishes a date and time
before which the <a>credential</a> should not be considered <a>verified</a>. The
<code>verificationMethod</code> <a>property</a> specifies, for example, the
public key that can be used to verify the digital signature. Dereferencing a
public key URL reveals information about the controller of the key, which can
be checked against the issuer of the <a>credential</a>. The
<code>proofPurpose</code> <a>property</a> clearly expresses the purpose for
the proof and ensures this information is protected by the signature. A proof is
typically attached to a <a>verifiable presentation</a> for authentication
purposes and to a <a>verifiable credential</a> as a method of assertion.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Validity Periods</h3>

        <p>
The <code>validFrom</code> and <code>validUntil</code> properties are expected
to be within an expected range for the <a>verifier</a>. For example, a
<a>verifier</a> can check that the end of the validity period of a <a>verifiable
credential</a> is not in the past.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Status</h3>

        <p>
If the <code>credentialStatus</code> property is available, the status of a
<a>verifiable credential</a> is expected to be evaluated by the <a>verifier</a>
according to the <code>credentialStatus</code> <a>type</a> definition for the
<a>verifiable credential</a> and the <a>verifier's</a> own status evaluation
criteria. For example, a <a>verifier</a> can ensure the status of the
<a>verifiable credential</a> is not "withdrawn for cause by the <a>issuer</a>".
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Fitness for Purpose</h3>

        <p>
Fitness for purpose is about whether the custom <a>properties</a> in the
<a>verifiable credential</a> are appropriate for the <a>verifier's</a> purpose.
For example, if a <a>verifier</a> needs to determine whether a <a>subject</a> is
older than 21 years of age, they might rely on a specific <code>birthdate</code>
<a>property</a>, or on more abstract <a>properties</a>, such as
<code>ageOver</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
The <a>issuer</a> is trusted by the <a>verifier</a> to make the <a>claims</a> at
hand. For example, a franchised fast food restaurant location trusts the
discount coupon <a>claims</a> made by the corporate headquarters of the
franchise. Policy information expressed by the <a>issuer</a> in the
<a>verifiable credential</a> should be respected by <a>holders</a> and
<a>verifiers</a> unless they accept the liability of ignoring the policy.

SHA-256 digest by running the following command from a modern Unix command
interface line:
`curl -s https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2 | openssl dgst -sha256 -hex -r`.
It is strongly advised that all JSON-LD Contexts used in an application utilize
a similar mechanism to ensure end-to-end security.
          </p>
          <p>
This section serves as a reminder of the importance of ensuring that, when
verifying <a>verifiable credentials</a> and <a>verifiable presentations</a>, the
<a>verifier</a> has information that is consistent with what the <a>issuer</a>
or <a>holder</a> had when securing the <a>credential</a> or <a>presentation</a>.
This information might include at least:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
The contents of the credential itself, which is secured in
<a>verifiable credentials</a> and <a>verifiable presentations</a> by using
mechanisms such as [[VC-JWT]] and [[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY].
            </li>
            <li>
The content in a credential whose meaning depends on a link to an external URL,
such as a JSON-LD Context, which can be secured by using a local static copy,
or a cryptographic digest of the file.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
Verifiers are warned that other data that is referenced from within a
credential, such as resources that are linked to via URLs, are not
cryptographically protected by default. It is considered a best practice to
ensure that the same sorts of protections are provided for any URL that is
critical to the security of the credential through the use of permanently cached
files and/or cryptographic hashes. See the <a
data-cite="vc-imp-guide/#content-integrity">Content Integrity</a>
section of the Verifiable Credential Implementation Guide for further
information. Ultimately, knowing the cryptographic digest of any linked external
content enables a <a>verifier</a> to confirm that the content is the same
as what the <a>issuer</a> or <a>holder</a> intended.

        <h3>Differences between Contexts, Types, and CredentialSchemas</h3>

        <p>
The <a>verifiable credential</a> and <a>verifiable presentation</a> data models
leverage a variety of underlying technologies including [[JSON-LD]] and
[[?CREDENTIAL-SCHEMA-2022]]. This section will provide a comparison of the
<code>@context</code>, <code>type</code>, and <code>credentialSchema</code>
properties, and cover some of the more specific use cases where it is possible
to use these features of the data model.
        </p>

        <p>
The <code>type</code> property is used to uniquely identify
the type of the <a>verifiable credential</a> in which it appears, i.e., to
indicate which set of claims the <a>verifiable credential</a> contains.
This property, and the value <code>VerifiableCredential</code> within the set of
its values, are mandatory. Whilst it is good practice to include one additional
value depicting the unique subtype of this <a>verifiable credential</a>, it is permitted
to either omit or include additional type values in the array. Many
verifiers will request a <a>verifiable credential</a> of a specific subtype, then
omitting the subtype value could make it more difficult for verifiers to inform
the holder which <a>verifiable credential</a> they require. When a <a>verifiable
credential</a> has multiple subtypes, listing all of them in the <code>type</code>
property is sensible. While the semantics are the same in both a [[JSON]] and
[[JSON-LD]] representation, the usage of the <code>type</code> property in a
[[JSON-LD]] representation of a <a>verifiable credential</a> is able to enforce the semantics of the
<a>verifiable credential</a> better than a [[JSON]] representation of the same
credential because the machine is able to check the semantics. With [[JSON-LD]],
the technology is not only describing the categorization of the set of claims,
the technology is also conveying the structure and semantics of the sub-graph of
the properties in the graph. In [[JSON-LD]], this represents the type of the node
in the graph which is why some [[JSON-LD]] representations of a <a>verifiable
credential</a> will use the <code>type</code> property on many objects in the
<a>verifiable credential</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
The primary purpose of the <code>@context</code> property, from a [[JSON-LD]]
perspective, is to convey the meaning of the data and term definitions of the
data in a <a>verifiable credential</a>, in a machine readable way. When encoding a pure
[[JSON]] representation, the <code>@context</code> property remains mandatory and
provides some basic support for global semantics. The <code>@context</code>
property is used to map the globally unique URLs for properties in <a>verifiable
credentials</a> and <a>verifiable presentations</a> into short-form alias names,
making both the [[JSON]] and [[JSON-LD]] representations more human-friendly
to read. From a [[JSON-LD]] perspective, this mapping also allows the data in
a <a>credential</a> to be modeled in a network of machine-readable data, by
enhancing how the data in the <a>verifiable credential</a> or <a>verifiable
presentation</a> relates to a larger machine-readable data graph. This is
useful for telling machines how to relate the meaning of data to
other data in an ecosystem where parties are unable to coordinate. This
property, with the first value in the set being
<code>https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2</code>, is mandatory.
        </p>

        <p>
Since the <code>@context</code> property is used to map data to a graph
data model, and the <code>type</code> property in [[JSON-LD]] is used to
describe nodes within the graph, the <code>type</code> property becomes
even more important when using the two properties in combination. For example,
if the <code>type</code> property is not included within the resolved
<code>@context</code> resource using [[JSON-LD]], it could lead to claims being
dropped and/or their integrity no longer being protected during production and
consumption of the <a>verifiable credential</a>. Alternatively, it could lead to
errors being raised during production or consumption of a <a>verifiable
credential</a>. This will depend on the design choices of the implementation and
both paths are used in implementations today, so it's important to pay attention
to these properties when using a [[JSON-LD]] representation of a <a>verifiable
credential</a> or <a>verifiable presentation</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
The primary purpose of the <code>credentialSchema</code> property is to
define the structure of the <a>verifiable credential</a>, and the datatypes for
the values of each property that appears. A <code>credentialSchema</code> is useful
for defining the contents and structure of a set of claims in a <a>verifiable
credential</a>, whereas [[JSON-LD]] and a <code>@context</code> in a <a>verifiable
credential</a> are best used only for conveying the semantics and term
definitions of the data, and can be used to define the structure of the
<a>verifiable credential</a> as well.
        </p>

        <p>
While it is possible to use some [[JSON-LD]] features to allude to the
contents of the <a>verifiable credential</a>, it's not generally
suggested to use <code>@context</code> to constrain the data types of the
data model. For example, <code>"@type": "@json"</code> is useful for leaving the
semantics open-ended and not strictly defined. This can be dangerous if
the implementer is looking to constrain the data type of the claims in the
<a>credential</a>, and is expected not to be used.
          </p>

        <p>
When the <code>credentialSchema</code> and <code>@context</code> properties
are used in combination, both producers and consumers can be more confident
about the expected contents and data types of the <a>verifiable credential</a>
and <a>verifiable presentation</a>.

    Note that while the Verifiable Credentials format uses JSON-LD

    This media type can be used with credentials secured using an <a>external proof</a>.

  <p>A [[JSON-LD]] context is expected to be present in the body of the document, and as indicated by the presence of `ld+json` in the media type, the credential is expected to be a valid <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#dfn-json-ld-document">JSON-LD document</a>.</p>

      <h2>Revision History</h2>

      <p>
This section contains the substantive changes that have been made to this
specification over time.
      </p>

      <p>
Changes since the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/REC-vc-data-model-20220303/">
v1.1 Recommendation</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
Increment version number to v2.0 and remove prior REC-track comments.
        </li>
        <li>
Add normative dependency on Verifiable Credential Data Integrity specification
[[VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]].
        </li>
        <li>
The section on
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/REC-vc-data-model-20220303/#disputes">Disputes</a>
was removed due to lack of implementations in v1.0 and v1.1.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
Changes since the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/REC-vc-data-model-20191119/">
v1.0 Recommendation</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
Add this revision history section.
        </li>

        <li>
Update previous normative references that pointed to RFC3339 for datetime
details to now normatively reference the datetime details described in
XMLSCHEMA11-2 which more accurately reflects the usage in examples and
libraries.
        </li>

        <li>
Loosen the requirement to allow <a>URLs</a> that cannot be dereferenced in the
<code>id</code> property of the <code>credentialStatus</code> and
<code>refreshService</code> sections of the data model.
        </li>

        <li>
Loosen normative statements in the zero-knowledge proofs section to enable
compliance of new zero-knowledge proof schemes, such as BBS+, that have been
created since the v1.0 specification was published as a Recommendation.
        </li>

        <li>
Update all references to point to the latest version of the referenced
specifications. Fix broken links to papers that have become unavailable to
updated locations where the papers are available.
        </li>

        <li>
Increase accessibility of SVG diagrams.
        </li>

        <li>
Fix editorial bugs in a few examples related to `issuer`, `issuanceDate`,
`credentialStatus`, dates, dead links, and minor syntax errors.
        </li>

        <li>
Move acknowledgements from Status of the Document section into the
Acknowledgements appendix.
